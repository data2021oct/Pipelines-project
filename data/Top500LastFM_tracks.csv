It initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 in the Billboard 200, a significantly lower placement than the band\'s preceding albums. In the United Kingdom, the album was hailed by its music press and was an immediate commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart and remaining among the top ten positions for six months. Pet Sounds has subsequently gathered worldwide acclaim from critics and musicians alike, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums in music history.\n\nThe album was produced and arranged by Brian Wilson, who also wrote and composed almost all of its music. Most of the recording sessions were conducted between January and April 1966, a year after he had quit touring with the Beach Boys in order to focus more attention on writing and recording. For Pet Sounds, Wilson\'s goal was to create ""the greatest rock album ever made"" — a personalised work with no filler tracks. It is sometimes considered a Wilson solo album, repeating the themes and ideas he had introduced with The Beach Boys Today! one year earlier. The album\'s lead single, ""Caroline, No"", was issued as his official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: ""Wouldn\'t It Be Nice"" (backed with ""God Only Knows"") and ""Sloop John B"".\n\nCollaborating with lyricist Tony Asher, Wilson\'s symphonic arrangements wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unusual instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans, and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars. Unified by Wall of Sound-style production techniques, the album comprised Wilson\'s ""pet sounds"", consisting mainly of introspective songs like ""You Still Believe in Me"", about faithfulness, ""I Know There\'s an Answer"", a critique of LSD users, and ""I Just Wasn\'t Made for These Times"", an autobiographical statement on social alienation (as well as the first use of a theremin-like instrument on a rock record). Recording was completed on April 13, 1966, with an unprecedented total production cost that exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $520,000 in 2016). A follow-up album, Smile, was immediately planned, but left unfinished. In 1997, a ""making-of"" version of Pet Sounds was supervised by Wilson and released as The Pet Sounds Sessions, containing the album\'s first true stereo mix.\n\nPet Sounds is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the field of music production, introducing non-standard harmonies and timbres, and incorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde. A heralding work of psychedelia, the album furthered an aesthetic trend within rock by helping it transform from dance music into music that was made for listening to, elevating itself to the level of art rock. Author Bill Martin said that Pet Sounds represents a turning point where the Beach Boys ""brought expansions in harmony, instrumentation (and therefore timbre), duration, rhythm, and the use of recording technology. Of these elements, the first and last were the most important in clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock."" In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" One year earlier, Rolling Stone ranked it second on its list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"".

The opening ""Love\'s in Need of Love Today"" and ""Have a Talk with God"" are curiously subdued, but Stevie soon kicks into gear with ""Village Ghetto Land,"" a fierce exposé of ghetto neglect set to a satirical Baroque synthesizer. Hot on its heels comes the torrid fusion jam ""Contusion,"" a big, brassy hit tribute to the recently departed Duke Ellington in ""Sir Duke,"" and (another hit, this one a Grammy winner as well) the bumping poem to his childhood, ""I Wish."" Though they didn\'t necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Fans of the love album Talking Book can marvel that he sets the bar even higher here, with brilliant material like the tenderly cathartic and gloriously redemptive ""Joy Inside My Tears,"" the two-part, smooth-and-rough ""Ordinary Pain,"" the bitterly ironic ""All Day Sucker,"" or another classic heartbreaker, ""Summer Soft."" Those inclined toward Stevie Wonder the social-issues artist had quite a few songs to focus on as well: ""Black Man"" was a Bicentennial school lesson on remembering the vastly different people who helped build America; ""Pastime Paradise"" examined the plight of those who live in the past and have little hope for the future; ""Village Ghetto Land"" brought listeners to a nightmare of urban wasteland; and ""Saturn"" found Stevie questioning his kinship with the rest of humanity and amusingly imagining paradise as a residency on a distant planet. If all this sounds overwhelming, it is; Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-\'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst.

Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics.\n\nNevermind was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". By January 1992 it had replaced Michael Jackson\'s album Dangerous at number one on the Billboard charts. Nevermind was responsible for bringing alternative rock to a large mainstream audience, and would subsequently be regarded as one of the best rock albums of all time.\n\nNirvana was a band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic, that had signed to Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. The group released its debut album Bleach in 1989, with Chad Channing on drums. However, Channing left Nirvana in 1990, and the band was in need of a permanent drummer. Upon seeing a show by hardcore punk band Scream, the group\'s drummer, Dave Grohl, impressed Novoselic and Cobain. When Scream unexpectedly disbanded, Grohl contacted Novoselic, made his way to Seattle, and was soon invited to join the band. Novoselic said in retrospect that when Grohl joined the band, everything ""fell into place"".\n\nMeanwhile Cobain was writing a number of new songs. At the time Cobain was listening to bands like R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene which Sub Pop had built its image upon, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single ""Sliver"", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said ""was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that."" Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children\'s music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.\n\nBy the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was experiencing financial difficulties. With rumors that Sub Pop would sign up as a subsidiary for a major label, the band decided to ""cut out the middleman"" and start to look for a major label. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon the recommendation of its management, who also managed the band\'s idols (and recent Geffen signings) Sonic Youth, and Sonic Youth\'s Kim Gordon.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, Nirvana began planning its second album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig as a potential producer. Nirvana particularly liked Vig\'s work with Killdozer and called Vig up to tell him, ""We want to sound as heavy as that record."" In April 1990, the band traveled out to Vig\'s Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to begin work on the album. Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately, eight songs were recorded: ""Immodium"" (later renamed ""Breed""), ""Dive"" (later released as the B-side to ""Sliver""), ""In Bloom"", ""Pay to Play"" (eventually renamed ""Stay Away"" and given a new set of lyrics), ""Sappy"", ""Lithium"", ""Here She Comes Now"" (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and Hell Volume 1), and ""Polly"". The band had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain blew his voice out on ""Lithium"", forcing them to shut down recording. Vig was told that the band would come back to record more songs, but the producer did not hear anything for a while. Instead, the band used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels, creating a buzz around the group.\n\nAfter signing to Geffen, a number of producers for the album were suggested, including Scott Litt, David Briggs, and Don Dixon, but Nirvana held out for Vig. Novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already nervous about recording on a major label, since the producers suggested wanted percentage points for the album, and they optioned for Vig, with whom they felt comfortable collaborating. Afforded a budget of $65,000, Nirvana recorded Nevermind at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, California in May and June 1991. Nirvana was originally set to record the album during March and April 1991, but the date kept getting pushed back in spite of the band\'s anxiousness to begin the sessions. To pay gas money to get to Los Angeles, Nirvana played a show where they played ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" for the first time. The band sent Vig some rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at Smart Studios, along with some new ones including ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Come as You Are"".\n\nWhen the group arrived in California, Nirvana did a few days of pre-production where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song ""Polly"", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes weren\'t satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain\'s phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song ""In Bloom"" by telling him ""John Lennon did it."" While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: ""He\'d be great for an hour, and then he\'d sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour.""\n\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were turning out. As a result, they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing, with Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands. Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced Slayer\'s 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) from the bottom of the list. Novoselic recalled, ""We said, \'right on,\' because those Slayer records were so heavy."" Wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years later that upon hearing Wallace\'s work the band loved the mixes. After the album\'s release members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, ""Looking back on the production of Nevermind, I\'m embarrassed by it now. It\'s closer to a Mötley Crüe record than it is a punk rock record.""\n\nNevermind was mastered on the afternoon of August 2 in The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called ""Endless, Nameless"" intended to appear at the end of ""Something in the Way"", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, ""In the beginning, it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn\'t write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn\'t on there."" When the band discovered the song\'s omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of ""Something in the Way"" and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.\n\nNevermind was released on September 24, 1991. American record stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies, while 35,000 copies were shipped in the United Kingdom, where Bleach had been successful. The lead single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" had been released on September 10 with the intention of being a base-building cut among alternative rock fans, while the next single ""Come As You Are"" would be the song that would possibly garner more attention. The band set out on a short American tour four days before the release date to support the album. Geffen Records hoped that Nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies, which was the same level the record company had achieved with Sonic Youth\'s Geffen debut Goo. The best estimate was that if all involved worked hard, the record could possibly be certified Gold by September 1992.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at position 144, which was high enough for the album to top the Heatseekers chart as well. Geffen shipped about half of the initial US pressing to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song\'s video had received a world premiere on MTV\'s late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, ""Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don\'t give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It\'s cool—I guess.""\n\nAs the band set out for their European tour at the start of November 1991, Nevermind entered the Billboard Top 40 for the first time at number 35. By this point, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" had become a genuine hit and the album was selling so fast none of Geffen\'s marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted. Geffen president Ed Rosenblatt told The New York Times, ""We didn\'t do anything. It was just one of those \'Get out of the way and duck\' records."" Nirvana found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold, television crews became a constant presence onstage, and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.\n\nNevermind became Nirvana\'s first number one album on January 11, 1992, replacing Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard charts. By this time, Nevermind was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. ""Come As You Are"" was finally released as the second single in March 1992; it peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Two more singles, ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"", were released from the album.\n\nNevermind was certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1991, and was certified Diamond in March 1999. It was also certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000 units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in March 2001. In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released Nevermind on vinyl as part of its ANADISQ 200 series, and as a 24-carat gold CD. The CD pressings included ""Endless, Nameless"". The LP version sold out quickly of its limited pressing, but the CD edition stayed in print.\n\nUpon the album\'s release, several mainstream newspapers and magazines gave Nevermind positive reviews. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, ""With \'Nevermind,\' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment."" Schoemer concluded, ""\'Nevermind\' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered."" Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind Nirvana ""never entertain the notion"" of wanting to sound ""normal,"" compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that ""When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right.""\n\nRolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars; reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, ""If Nirvana isn\'t onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio\'s high-octane hits."" The Boston Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve Morse wrote, ""Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers,"" and added ""the band has little or nothing to say, settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist Cobain.""\n\nNevermind was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll; ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls. Nevermind topped the poll by a large majority, and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in his companion piece to the poll, ""As a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory, like De La Soul in 1990. Instead, their multi-platinum takeover constituted the first full-scale public validation of the Amerindie values—the noise, the toons, the \'tude—the radder half of the Pazz & Jop poll electorate came up on.""\n\nCobain, Nirvana\'s main songwriter, fashioned chord sequences that were based mainly around power chords and wrote songs that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar rhythms. His aim for Nevermind\'s material was to sound like the ""Bay City Rollers getting molested by Black Flag"". Many of the songs on Nevermind feature shifts in dynamics, where the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses. Dave Grohl said this approach originated during a four-month period prior to the recording of the album, where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions.\n\nGuitar World wrote, ""Kurt Cobain\'s guitar sound on Nirvana\'s Nevermind set the tone for Nineties rock music."" On Nevermind, Cobain played a 1960s Fender Mustang, a Fender Jaguar with DiMarzio pickups, and a few Fender Stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups. The guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as his main effects, the latter used to generate a ""watery"" sound on ""Come as You Are"" and the pre-choruses of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Krist Novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to D flat ""to get this fat-ass sound"".\n\nGrohl said that Cobain told him, ""Music comes first, lyrics come second,"" and Grohl believes that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album\'s lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain\'s phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain\'s singing was not paramount. Vig said, ""Even though you couldn\'t quite tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as hell."" Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing ""Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they\'ve transcribed them incorrectly?""\n\nCharles R. Cross asserted in his 2001 biography of Kurt Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, that many of the songs written for Nevermind were about Cobain\'s dysfunctional relationship with Tobi Vail. After the relationship ended, Cobain began writing and painting violent scenes, many of which revealed hatred for himself and others. Songs written during this period were less violent, but still reflected anger absent from Cobain\'s earlier songs. Cross wrote ""In the four months following their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs, all of them about Tobi Vail"". ""Drain You"" begins with the line ""One baby to another said \'I\'m lucky to have met you\'"", quoting what Vail had once told Cobain, and the line ""It is now my duty to completely drain you"" refers to the power Vail had over Kurt in their relationship. According to Novoselic, ""\'Lounge Act\' is about Tobi"", and the song contains the line ""I\'ll arrest myself, I\'ll wear a shield"", referring to Cobain having the K Records logo tattooed on his arm to impress Vail. Though ""Lithium"" had been written before Cobain knew Vail, the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her. Cobain also said in an interview with Musician that ""some of my very personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling–very lonely, sick.""\n\nThe album\'s tentative title Sheep was something Cobain created as an inside joke towards the people he expected to buy the record. He wrote a fake ad for Sheep in his journal that read ""Because you want to not; because everyone else is."" Novoselic said the inspiration for the title was the band\'s cynicism about the public\'s reaction to Operation Desert Storm. As recording sessions for the album were completed, Cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to Novoselic that the new album be named Nevermind. Cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life, and because it was grammatically incorrect.\n\nThe Nevermind album cover shows a baby swimming toward a US dollar bill on a fishhook. According to Cobain, he conceived the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen\'s art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Also, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use, so instead Fisher sent a photographer to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on the image of a three-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of the photographer\'s friend Rick Elden. However, there was some concern because Elden\'s penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain made it clear that the only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say, ""If you\'re offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile.""\n\nThe back cover of the album features a photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante\'s Inferno, and pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain\'s collection of medical photos. Cobain noted, ""If you look real close, there is a picture of Kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef."" The album\'s liner notes contain no complete song lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem.\n\nNevermind not only popularized the Seattle grunge movement, but also brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Nevermind\'s success surprised Nirvana\'s contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi\'s Guy Picciotto later commented: ""It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did"". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that in the aftermath of the album\'s breakthrough, ""Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions"". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.\n\nMichael Azerrad argued in his Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana (1993) that Nevermind marked the emergence of a generation of music fans in their twenties in a climate dominated by the musical tastes of the baby boomer generation that preceded them. Azerrad wrote, ""Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to."" Rolling Stone wrote in its entry for Nevermind on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, ""No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator.""\n\nNevermind has continued to garner critical praise since its release. The album was listed at number seventeen on Rolling Stone\'s list ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". Time placed Nevermind, which writer Josh Tyrangiel called ""the finest album of the 90s,"" on its 2006 list of ""The All-TIME 100 Albums."" Pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade, noting that ""anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool, and needs to be trying harder."" In 2005, the Library of Congress added Nevermind to the National Recording Registry, which collects ""culturally, historically or aesthetically important"" sound recordings from the 20th century. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac\'s most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album\'s lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record\'s tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album\'s release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\n\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac\'s best release, it has featured in several publications\' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.\n\nIn July 1975, Fleetwood Mac\'s tenth album was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in 1976. The record\'s hit single ""Rhiannon"" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac\'s line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975\'s Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo\'s arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.\n\nPress intrusions into the band members\' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood\'s daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the ""tremendous emotional sacrifices"" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band\'s interests.\n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Rumours"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As of 2009, the album has sold over 19 million copies worldwide and over 10 million copies in the US alone, with the RIAA giving it Diamond status .\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1997, Hill began production on an album that would eventually become The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The title was partially inspired by The Education of Sonny Carson, a film and autobiographical novel about a troubled African American youth. The album includes collaborations with soul singer D\'Angelo on ""Nothing Even Matters"", guitarist Carlos Santana on ""To Zion"", singer Mary J. Blige on ""I Used to Love Him""; as well as then little-known John Legend playing the piano on ""Everything is Everything"". Songs for the album were largely written in an attic studio in South Orange, New Jersey and recorded at Chung King Studios in Jamaica. Wyclef Jean, Hill\'s bandmate with The Fugees, initially didn\'t support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill declined his assistance.\n\nSeveral songs on the album concerned her frustrations with The Fugees; ""I Used to Love Him"" dealt with the break-down of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. ""To Zion"" spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy as to not interfere with her blossoming career.\n\nThe Miseducation contained several interludes of a teacher speaking to what is implied to be a classroom of children; in fact, the ""teacher"" was played by Ras Baraka (a poet, educator and politician) speaking to a group of kids in the living room of Hill\'s New Jersey home. The singer requested that Baraka speak to the children about the concept of love, and he improvised the lecture.\n\n1998 saw the release of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which was both critically and commercially successful. The landmark concept album set new records for black women, female hip-hop artists, and women in general. It sold over 423,000 copies in its first week and topped the Billboard 200 albums chart for four weeks and the Billboard R&B Album chart for six weeks; it would go on to sell more than 18 million copies over the next decade. The first single off the album was ""Lost Ones"" (US #27), released in Spring 1998. The second was ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"", which reached #1 in the billboard charts. Other singles released in support of the album were ""Ex-Factor"" (US #21), ""Everything Is Everything"" (US #35), and ""To Zion"".\n\nAt the 1999 Grammy Awards, Hill was nominated ten times , becoming the first female ever to be nominated ten times in one year: Hill won five Grammys including Album of the Year, Best R&B Album, Best R&B Song, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. Lauryn Hill set a new record in the industry, as she became the first woman to win five Grammys in one night. Between 1998 and 1999, Hill earned $25 million from record sales and touring.\n\nHill became a national media icon, as magazines ranging from Time to Esquire to Teen People vied to put her on the cover. By the end of the year, as the album topped virtually every major music critic\'s best-of list, she was being credited for helping fully assimilate hip-hop into mainstream music.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Hill was noted by some as a humanitarian. In 1996 she received an Essence Award for work which has included the 1996 founding of the Refugee Project, an outreach organization that supports a two-week overnight camp for at-risk youth, and for supporting well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, as well as for staging a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. In 1999 Hill received three awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards. In 1999 Ebony named her one of ""100+ Most Influential Black Americans"". She was named with Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. and others among the ""10 For Tomorrow,"" in the EBONY 2000: Special Millennium Issue.\n\nIn 2003, VH1 named it the 37th greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 312 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Chris Rock ranked it 23rd in his 2005 list of the Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all time. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named "" The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" second on the greatest albums in the past 25 years.\n\nLawsuit\n\nThough The Miseducation was largely a collaborative work between Hill and a group of musicians known as New Ark (Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold and Johari Newton), there was ""label pressure to do the Prince thing,"" wherein all tracks would be credited as ""written and produced by"" the artist with little outside help. While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, ""We all love each other. This ain\'t about documents. This is blessed.""\n\nIn 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page lawsuit against Hill, her management, and her record label, stating that Hill ""used their songs and production skills but failed to properly credit them for the work."" The musicians claimed that they either wrote or produced 13 of 14 tracks on Miseducation , despite the liner notes of the album claiming that it was ""produced, written, arranged and performed by Lauryn Hill."" New Ark requested partial writing credits and monetary reimbursement. The suit was settled out of court in February 2001 for a reported $5 million.\n\nNew Ark\'s lawyer, Peter C. Harvey, scoffed at Hill\'s image as a prolific songwriter. “She is not a musician, she is not a producer...I dare say if you put Lauryn Hill in a studio alone, she couldn’t do it again."" . In a 2005 Interview, Lauryn responded saying "" I am a Songwriter, Producer and a Musician and that I gave people too much credit that they didn\'t truly deserve. I can do it again, because I am a Artist thats speaks from my heart and from my mind. If people benefit off my new music to come then so be it, I will only make music to give information to my own children"".\n\nAs of 2009, Hill has released only one album after Miseducation - 2001\'s MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 - which sold a fraction of Miseducation\'s numbers.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lauryn+Hill/The+Miseducation+of+Lauryn+Hill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, Thriller\'s lyrics deal with generally darker themes, including paranoia and the supernatural.\n\nWith a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of Thriller\'s nine tracks. Following the release of the album\'s first single ""The Girl Is Mine"", some observers assumed Thriller would only be a minor hit record. With the release of the second single ""Billie Jean"", the album topped the charts in many countries. It reached number one in the United States and the United Kingdom simultaneously, becoming the first album to do so. At its peak, the album was selling a million copies a week worldwide. In just over a year, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. Sales are estimated to be over 110 million copies sold worldwide as of March 2010. Seven of the album\'s nine songs were released as singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Despite numerous five-star reviews, Thriller was not universally praised.\n\nThriller cemented Jackson as one of the predominant pop stars of the late 20th century, and enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools—the videos for Thriller, ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It"" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song ""Someone In the Dark"", which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD.\n\nThriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. Thriller was preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry, as it was deemed ""culturally significant"".\n\nProducer: Quincy Jones\nCo-producer, lead and backup vocals: Michael Jackson\nGuitar: David Williams, Dean Parks, Steve Lukather, Paul Jackson\nBass: Louis Johnson, Steve Lukather\nSaxophone and flute: Larry Williams\nTrumpet and flügelhorn: Jerry Hey, Gary Grant\nTrombone: Bill Reichenbach\nDrums: Jeff Porcaro and N\'dugu Chancler\nPercussion: Paulinho Da Costa\nKeyboards/synthesizers/programming: Greg Phillinganes, Steve Porcaro, David Paich, Brian Banks\nKeyboards/synthesizers: Michael Boddicker, David Foster, Bill Wolfer, Rod Temperton\nSynthesizer programming: Anthony Marinelli\nHorn and string arrangements: Jerry Hey\nBackup vocals: James Ingram, Bunny Hull and Becky Lopez\nRecording engineer/mixer: Bruce Swedien\nTechnical engineer: Matt Forger\n\nReleased November 30, 1982\nRecorded April 4 November 8, 1982, Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, California\nGenre Pop, R&B, Funk, Soul\nLength 42:19\nLabel Epic EK-38112 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although it originally received mixed reviews, Exile on Main St. has been ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.The 2010 remastered version of the album was released in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States on 18 May 2010, featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks\n\nRecording:\nExile on Main St. was written and recorded between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said ""After we got out of our contract with Allen Klein, we didn\'t want to give him ,"" as they were forced to do with ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Wild Horses"" from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger\'s Stargroves country house in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers.By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Mick Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellcôte, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where they could continue work on the album, Richards\' basement at Nellcôte became a makeshift studio using the band\'s mobile recording truck.\n\n1st Stage ar Nellcôte :\nRecording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. Bassist Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night, every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the month. Wyman said of that period, ""Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me, one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellcôte things were very different and it took me a while to understand why."" By this time Richards had begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week in addition to a contingent of visitors that included William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons and Marshall Chess (who was running the Rolling Stones\' new label). Parsons was asked to leave Nellcôte in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behaviour and an attempt by Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police.\nRichards\' substance abuse prevented him from attending the sessions that continued in his basement, while Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman were often unable to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording of one of Richards\' most famous songs, ""Happy"". Recorded in the basement, Richards said in 1982, ""\'Happy\' was something I did because I was for one time early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it\'s the record, it\'s the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, \'Wow, yeah, work on it\'"".\nThe basic band for the Nellcôte sessions consisted of Richards, Bobby Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Miller (a skilled drummer in his own right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned ""Happy"" and ""Shine a Light""), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambience of Richards\' villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player Magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between the band members who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor, engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger)\n\n2nd stage in Los Angeles:\nAdditional basic tracks (probably only ""Rip this Joint"", ""Shake Your Hips"", ""Casino Boogie"", ""Happy"", ""Rocks Off"", ""Turd on the Run"" and ""Ventilator Blues"") were begun in the basement of Nellcôte and taken to Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles where numerous overdubs (all piano and keyboard parts, all lead and backing vocals, all guitar and bass overdubs) were added during sessions that meandered from December 1971 until May 1972. Some tracks (such as ""Torn and Frayed"" and ""Loving Cup"") were freshly recorded in Los Angeles. Although Jagger was frequently missing from Nellcôte, he took charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr John and the cream of the city\'s session backup vocalists to record layers of overdubs. The final gospel-inflected arrangements of ""Tumbling Dice"", ""Loving Cup"", ""Let It Loose"" and ""Shine a Light"" were inspired by Jagger and Preston\'s visit to a local evangelical church.\nThe extended recording sessions and differing methods on the part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction, which Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade.\n\nMusic and lyrics:\nEven though the album is often described as being Richards\' finest moment, as Exile is often thought to reflect his vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album\'s release. With Richards\' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group\'s subsequent 1970s releases—directed largely by Jagger—would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the roots-based sound of Exile on Main St Music biographer John Perry wrote that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that was ""entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s-1940s swing"".\nAccording to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expanded on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers: ""It piled all the old themes—sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release—on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music\n\nRelease and reception: \nPreceded by the UK and US Top 10 hit ""Tumbling Dice"", Exile on Main St was released in May 1972. It was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. ""Happy"", sung by Richards, would be a Top 30 US hit later that summer.\nBy the late 1970s, critics had come to view Exile on Main St as the Rolling Stones\' greatest album. Lenny Kaye of Rolling Stone observed ""a tight focus on basic components of the Stones\' sound as we\'ve always known it, knock-down rock and roll stemming from blues, backed with a pervading feeling of blackness that the Stones have seldom failed to handle well."" He felt that there are songs that are better, there are songs that are worse, and others you\'ll probably lift the needle for when the time is due"", and asserted that ""the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come"". Other critics praised the album\'s rawness and different styles, from blues to country to soul. Richard Williams of Melody Maker said that the album ""is definitely going to take its place in history"" and called it ""the best album they\'ve ever made"", writing that it ""utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock \'n\' rollers."" Bill Janovitz called it ""the greatest, most soulful, rock & roll record ever made"" because it seamlessly distills ""perhaps all the essential elements of rock & roll up to 1971, if not beyond"". In his year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972 and wrote that ""this fagged-out masterpiece"" was the peak of rock music in 1972 and that it ""explores new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick\'s voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui"".\nOn the initial critical and commercial reaction, Richards said, ""When  came out it didn\'t sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.""\nExile on Main St featured a gatefold cover and included a series of 12 perforated postcards with a sequence of images inserts, all of which were shot by photographer Norman Seeff. The back cover features various photos of the Stones; the ""mystery woman"" pictured in the lower left side is Chris O\'Dell, their personal assistant. The album photography and concept was by Robert Frank and includes images from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. The ""Joe Allen"" pictured in the collage is of a postcard-style advertisement by Frank of the contortionist, Joe Allen, billed as ""The Human Corkscrew"" for his ability to wiggle and twist through the ""13 1/2 inch hoop"" approximately 25,000 times during his circus career, according to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 8 May 1950. The man with the three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a ""5"" billiard ball) in his mouth is formally known as ""Three Ball Charlie"", a 1930\'s sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska who could also not only balance on several balls at once, but could also juggle balls, and whistle, all while performing all 4 tasks simultaneously, according to Ripley\'s\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n1.\t""Rocks Off""  \t4:31\n2.\t""Rip This Joint""  \t2:22\n3.\t""Shake Your Hips"" (Slim Harpo)\t2:59\n4.\t""Casino Boogie""  \t3:33\n5.\t""Tumbling Dice""  \t3:45\nSide two\t\nNo.\t   Title\t    Length\t\n6.\t""Sweet Virginia""  \t4:27\n7.\t""Torn and Frayed""  \t4:17\n8.\t""Sweet Black Angel""  \t2:54\n9.\t""Loving Cup""  \t4:25\nSide three\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n10.\t""Happy""  \t3:04\n11.\t""Turd on the Run""  \t2:36\n12.\t""Ventilator Blues"" (Jagger/Richards/Mick Taylor)\t3:24\n13.\t""I Just Want to See His Face""  \t2:52\n14.\t""Let It Loose""  \t5:16\nSide four\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n15.\t""All Down the Line""  \t3:49\n16.\t""Stop Breaking Down"" (Robert Johnson)\t4:34\n17.\t""Shine a Light""  \t4:14\n18.\t""Soul Survivor""  \n\n\nPersonnel\nMick Jagger – lead vocals, harmonica, percussion; guitar on ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Stop Breaking Down""\nKeith Richards – guitars, backing vocals; lead vocals on ""Happy""; electric piano on ""I Just Want to See His Face""; bass guitar on ""Casino Boogie"", ""Happy"" and ""Soul Survivor""\nMick Taylor – guitars, slide guitar; bass guitar on ""Tumbling Dice"", ""Torn and Frayed"", ""I Just Want to See His Face"" and ""Shine a Light""\nBill Wyman – bass guitar\nCharlie Watts – drums\nAdditional personnel\nNicky Hopkins – piano\nBobby Keys – saxophone, percussion on ""Happy""\nJim Price – trumpet, trombone, organ on ""Torn and Frayed""\nIan Stewart – piano on ""Shake Your Hips"", ""Sweet Virginia"" and ""Stop Breaking Down""\nJimmy Miller – drums on ""Tumbling Dice"" (the outro), ""Happy"" and ""Shine a Light"", percussion on ""Sweet Black Angel"", ""Loving Cup"", ""I Just Want to See His Face"" and ""All Down the Line""\nBill Plummer – upright bass on ""Rip This Joint"", ""Turd on the Run"", ""I Just Want to See His Face"" and ""All Down the Line""\nBilly Preston – piano and organ on ""Shine a Light""\nAl Perkins – pedal steel guitar on ""Torn and Frayed""\nRichard Washington – marimba on ""Sweet Black Angel""\nClydie King, Venetta Fields – backing vocals on ""Tumbling Dice"", ""I Just Want to See His Face"", ""Let It Loose"" and ""Shine a Light""\nJoe Green – backing vocals on ""Let It Loose"" and ""Shine a Light""\nChris Shepard – tambourine on ""Turd on the Run""\nJerry Kirkland – backing vocals on ""I Just Want to See His Face"" and ""Shine a Light""\nMac Rebennack, Shirley Goodman, Tami Lynn – backing vocals on ""Let It Loose""\nKathi McDonald – backing vocals on ""All Down the Line""\nEngineers – Glyn and Andy Johns, Joe Zaganno, Jeremy Gee\nCover photography/concept – Robert Frank\nLayout design – John Van Hamersveld, Norman Seeff\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Exile+on+Main+St."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recording sessions took place during 1987 at Chung King Studios, Greene St. Recording, and Sabella Studios in New York City. Noting the enthusiastic response toward their live shows, Public Enemy intended with Nation of Millions to make the music of a faster tempo than the previous album for performance purposes.\n\nThe album charted for 49 weeks on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 42. By August 1989, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of one million copies in the United States. The album was very well received by music critics, who hailed it for its production techniques and the socially and politically charged lyricism of lead MC Chuck D. It also appeared on many publications\' year-end top album lists for 1988, and was the runaway choice as the best album of 1988 in The Village Voice\'s Pazz & Jop critics\' poll, a poll of the leading music critics in the US.\n\nSince its initial reception, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been regarded by music writers and publications as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 48 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the highest ranking of all the hip hop albums on the list. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Public+Enemy/It+Takes+a+Nation+of+Millions+to+Hold+Us+Back"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album features guest appearances from Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, John Legend and more.\n\nProduction was led by West himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West\'s previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was released on November 22, 2010, by Roc-A-Fella Records. To promote the album, West released free songs through his GOOD Fridays series and four singles: the Billboard hits ""Power"", ""Monster"", and ""Runaway"", and the international hit ""All of the Lights"". It was also promoted with a short film set to the record\'s music, Runaway.

The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or music videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album was leaked before release.\n\nKid A debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead\'s first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead\'s earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Kid+A"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on August 25, 1975 through Columbia Records. It captured the heaviness of Springsteen\'s earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences.\n\nBorn to Run was a critical and commercial success and became Springsteen\'s breakthrough album. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and reached high positions on charts worldwide. Two singles were released from the album: ""Born to Run"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"", the first helped Springsteen to reach mainstream popularity. The tracks ""Thunder Road"" and ""Jungleland"" became staples of album-oriented rock radio and Springsteen concert high points. The album has been placed on several ""best ever"" lists and is listed in the Library of Congress\' National Recording Registry of historic recordings.\n\nOn November 14, 2005, a ""30th Anniversary"" remaster of the album was released as a box set including two DVDs: a production diary film and a concert movie. Being ranked number 18 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it is probably his magnum opus, although Born in the U.S.A. also received as much critical acclaim and as much success.\n\nSpringsteen began work on the album after touring in support of its previous album, The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, released in 1973. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of ""Born to Run"" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album\'s release. All in all the album took more than 14 months to record, with six months alone spent on the song ""Born To Run"" itself. During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard ""sounds in  head"" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. During the process, Springsteen brought in Jon Landau to help with production. This was the beginning of the breakup of Springsteen\'s relationship with producer and manager Mike Appel, after which Landau assumed both roles.\n\nOnce released, Born to Run was a breakthrough hit and catapulted his career from a northeast regional act to an acclaimed national and worldwide recording artist. This was his first album to feature pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg. Born to Run was released to overwhelming critical acclaim which swiftly spiralled into hype. While his previous two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, received good reviews, popular success had been scarce; Born to Run cemented Springsteen\'s reputation among critics and established his first mainstream fanbase.\n\nThe album is noted for its use of introductions to set the tone of each song (all of the record was composed on piano, not guitar), and for the Phil Spector-like ""Wall of Sound"" arrangements and production. Indeed, Springsteen has said that he wanted ""Born to Run"" to sound like ""Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan, produced by Spector."" Most of the tracks were first recorded with a core rhythm section band comprising Springsteen, Weinberg, Bittan, and bassist Garry Tallent, with other members\' contributions then added on.\n\nIn terms of the original LP\'s sequencing, Springsteen eventually adopted a ""four corners"" approach, as the songs beginning each side (""Thunder Road"", ""Born to Run"") were uplifting odes to escape, while the songs ending each side (""Backstreets"", ""Jungleland"") were sad epics of loss, betrayal, and defeat (Originally, he had planned to begin and end the album with alternative versions of ""Thunder Road"".)\n\nAlso, original pressings have ""Meeting Across the River"" billed as ""The Heist"". The original album cover has the title printed in a graffiti style font. These copies are very rare and considered to be the ""holy grail"" for Springsteen collectors.\n\nThe album\'s release was accompanied by a $250,000 promotional campaign by Columbia directed at both consumers and the music industry, making good use of Landau\'s ""I saw rock \'n\' roll\'s future—and its name is Bruce Springsteen"" quote. With much publicity, Born to Run vaulted into the top 10 in its second week on the charts and soon went Gold. Time and Newsweek magazines put Springsteen on the cover in the same week (October 27, 1975) – in Time, Jay Cocks praised Springsteen, while the Newsweek article took a cynical look at the ""next Dylan"" hype that haunted Springsteen until his breakthrough. The question of hype became a story in itself as critics began wondering if Springsteen was for real or the product of record company promotion.\n\nUpset with Columbia\'s promotion department, Springsteen said the decision to label him as the ""future of rock was a very big mistake and I would like to strangle the guy who thought that up."" When Springsteen arrived for his first UK concert at the Hammersmith Odeon, he personally tore down the ""Finally the world is ready for Bruce Springsteen"" posters in the lobby and ordered that the buttons with ""I have seen the future of rock \'n\' roll at the Hammersmith Odeon"" printed on them not be given out. Now fearing the hype might backfire, Columbia suspended all press interviews with Springsteen. When the hype died down, sales tapered off and the album was off the chart after 29 weeks. But the album had established a solid national fan base for Springsteen which he would build on with each subsequent release.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard Album Charts on September 13 1975 at #84. The following made an impressive increase entering the Top 10 at #8, then spent two weeks at #4, and finally, during the weeks of October 11 and October 18, Born to Run reached his peak position of #3. Those two weeks, the #1 album was John Denver\'s Windsong and the #2 was Pink Floyd\'s Wish You Were Here.\n\nBorn to Run continued to be a strong catalog seller through the years, re-entering the Billboard chart in late 1980 after The River was released, and again after the blockbuster success of Born in the U.S.A., spending most of 1985 on the chart. It was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1986, the first year in which pre-1976 releases were eligible for platinum and multi-platinum awards.\n\nIn 1987, Born to Run was ranked #8 on Rolling Stone\'s ""100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years"" and in 2003, Rolling Stone\'s ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" ranked Born to Run at number 18. In 2001, the TV network VH1 named it the 27th-greatest album of all time, and in 2003, it was ranked as the most popular album in the first Zagat Survey Music Guide.\n\nBorn to Run is listed in the Library of Congress\' National Recording Registry of historic recordings.\n\nIn December 2005, U.S. Representative Frank Pallone (who represents Asbury Park) and 21 co-sponsors sponsored H.Res. 628, ""Congratulating Bruce Springsteen of New Jersey on the 30th anniversary of his masterpiece record album \'Born to Run\', and commending him on a career that has touched the lives of millions of Americans."" In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. This bill, however, was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and died there. \n\nIn August 2009 it was announced Springsteen and the E Street Band would perform Born to Run in its entirety and in order during the fall concert tour. As a result, the concert date in Nashville, Tennessee was postponed from September until November.\n\nThe cover art of Born to Run is one of rock music\'s most popular and iconic images. It was taken by Eric Meola, who shot 900 frames in his three-hour session. These photos have been compiled in Born to Run: The Unseen Photos.\n\nThe photo shows Springsteen holding an electric guitar, a cross between a Fender Telecaster (body and pickups) and a Fender Esquire (neck), while leaning against saxophonist Clarence Clemons. After he plugged in an amp and started to play, he casually leaned on Clemons. That image became famous as the cover art. ""Other things happened,"" says Meola, ""but when we saw the contact sheets, that one just sort of popped. Instantly, we knew that was the shot."" Ultra-thin lettering graced the mass-produced version: an unusual touch then; a design classic since.\n\nThe Springsteen and Clemons cover pose has been imitated often, from Cheap Trick on the album Next Position Please, to Tom and Ray Magliozzi on the cover of the Car Talk compilation Born Not to Run: More Disrespectful Car Songs, to Kevin & Kell on a Sunday strip entitled ""Born to Migrate"" featuring Kevin Dewclaw as Bruce with a carrot and Kell Dewclaw as Clarence with a pile of bones, to Bert and the Cookie Monster on the cover of the Sesame Street album Born to Add. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/Born+to+Run"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The producer was George Martin, and the studio engineer was Geoff Emerick. Most critics agree with the choice of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, according to which this is the greatest rock album of all time. This album also has the most famous cover in rock history.\n\nReleased on 26 May 1967, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production, and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album\'s reception achieved full cultural legitimation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form.\n\nAt the end of August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles\' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP.\n\nThe album was loosely conceptualized as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. A key work of British psychedelia, it incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. The band continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group colored much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" and ""A Day in the Life"". The recording was completed on 21 April. The pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.\n\nMusicologists regard Sgt. Pepper was an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era\'s youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. It is considered one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the start of the album era. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honor; in 2003, the Library of Congress inducted it into the National Recording Registry. It has topped several critics\' and listeners\' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All-Time Top 1000 Albums, and the UK\'s ""Music of the Millennium"" poll. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and the UK\'s best-selling studio album, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011.\n\nThe beginning of the psychedelic era:\nAfter giving up the rock tour in August 1966, the Beatles\' popularity began to decline sharply, and the media began to speculate that the band had ""dried up"" under the onslaught of a new generation of rock artists, primarily genre-oriented psychedelic rock. A type of rock and roll that is produced under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, primarily LSD.\n\nThe Beatles have used these drugs before, but their impact on their music has not been overly pronounced (except for a few songs from the Revolver album, including the group\'s first psychedelic song, Tomorrow Never Knows). In February 1967, at the urging of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles released the single Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane, with songs originally planned for their next LP album. The single took second place on the charts and after several years; it was characterized as a failure. However, after this, the group did not leave the studio for several months.\n\nStudy work:\nWith the permission of producer George Martin to use certain amounts of drugs in the studio, the Beatles were led by Paul McCartney for the first time, because the former frontman, John Lennon, was depressed due to family problems. McCartney was the author of most of the songs on the album (including the title songs), however, Lennon also significantly contributed to this project with songs such as Being for Benefits of Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life, part of which was recorded by McCartney for his own song, but Martin added it to Lennon. All the songs of these two were later, by an earlier agreement, marked traditionally - Lennon / McCartney, but each author is the lead vocalist in his song, except in the case of the song ""With a Little Help of My Friends"", sung by the drummer, Ringo Starr. As for the studio technique, the previous 4-channel recording machine, ADT (Auto Double-Tracking) machine for doubling one\'s voice was used. In the coming period, this machine will be more and more popular, as the individuality of the members grows in the group, who will want to record most or even their entire songs on their own.\n\nCover:\nAccording to various sources, the cover was also McCartney\'s idea. The Beatles, in guard uniforms, with wind instruments, for the first time with a mustache and beard, are an integral part of all versions of this album. However, in the American edition, that is where it all ends, because there is only a yellow wall behind the group. In the British (European) edition, behind the ""Beatles"" there is a bunch of people, important in the then and past time - among them are Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Marilyn Monroe, ... However, the ""Beatles"" themselves with the look of before this album. Also, below the members of the group is a floral decor with the inscription ""The Beatles"". An album like this was a lure for many conspiracy theorists, so this is also one of the most mysterious covers of all time.\n\nThe final concept:\nThe whole album is connected by one theme, which was a kind of precedent and thus the ""Beatles"" became the creators of the so-called ""Concept album"". The protagonist of the story in question is a certain Billy Shears (when, thanks to the fact that he lent his voice in the song ""With a Little Help of My Friends"", interpreted by Ringo Starr), who modestly announces a performance after the pompous performance of the Sergeant Pepper Club more ""lonely hearts"", claiming that ""a little help from a friend"" is enough for him after a hard day. Then, in the following songs, the Beatles comment on various existential problems - from a normal working day (""Good Morning, Good Morning""), old age (""When I\'m 64"") to death itself and the problems around it (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamond ”, whose initial letters of the word, by the way, give the name of the drug LSD). The album closes with a slightly modified (""reprise"") version of the first song, which builds on the last, ""bis"" song - ""A Day in the Life"". The whole album is accompanied by studio applause from the audience and applause.\n\nAfter publication\nThe album was a great success and many still consider it the most successful LP of the group. He received positive criticism even from critics of classical music when Lennon and McCartney were compared to Shostakovich and proclaimed the greatest composers in the period after Beethoven. The group vowed not to use narcotics anymore, as it found its new inner peace in a new spiritual, Indian leader, Maharishi-Mash Yogi, who is the creator of transcendental meditation. It is certain, however, that all members continued to use drugs. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The US version of the album contains some of Hendrix\'s best known songs, including ""Purple Haze"", ""Hey Joe"", ""The Wind Cries Mary"" and ""Fire"". In 1987, as part of their 20th anniversary, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it #5 on ""The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years."" In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it #15 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was an instant success and was a best-selling album in the United States in 1968, and critics subsequently regarded it as one of the best rock albums of all time. In 2005 Are You Experienced was selected for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in the United States.\n\nHendrix, along with producer and former bass player for The Animals, Chas Chandler, formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in England in 1966 with Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass. The band signed with Track Records, a new label formed by The Who\'s managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. They recorded three singles produced by Chas Chandler while simultaneously touring throughout England: ""Hey Joe""/""Stone Free"", which was released in December 1966 through Polydor Records because Track Records was not yet operational; ""Purple Haze""/""51st Anniversary"", released in March 1967 and was the first release by Track Records on a special white label; and ""The Wind Cries Mary""/""Highway Chile"" which was released in May 1967 and is said to be written by Hendrix for his longtime love, Kathy Etchingham (whose middle name is Mary), after he was left alone at home when she stormed out after a fight. All three of these singles reached the top ten in the UK. The Experience\'s first single, ""Hey Joe"", reached #6 on the UK chart in early 1967, followed soon after by ""Purple Haze"", which peaked at #3 on the charts and its double platinum debut album, Are You Experienced. During the making of these singles, the Jimi Hendrix Experience also cut the tracks that became their debut album, which Chandler produced, again, mostly with engineer Dave Siddle at De Lane Lea Studios, he also used Mike Ross at CBS for several tracks. Some tracks were finished at Olympic Sudios with engineer Eddie Kramer, as was the final compilation, mixing and editing of the LP.\n\nThe album was recorded over a five month period, but relative to his later work, little time was spent in the studio. According to the background information in the 180 gram vinyl re-release as of 2010, Hendrix stated he wanted to record with ""the best gear and musicians available"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/Are+You+Experienced"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis\'s groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.\n\nIn 1953, the pianist George Russell published his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, which offered an alternative to the practice of improvisation based on chords and chord changes. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations: This approach led the way to ""modal"" in jazz. Influenced by Russell\'s ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his studio album Milestones (1958). Satisfied with the results, Davis prepared an entire album based on modality. Pianist Bill Evans, who had studied with Russell but recently departed from Davis\'s sextet to pursue his own career, was drafted back into the new recording project, the sessions that would become Kind of Blue.\n\nKind of Blue was recorded on three-track tape in two sessions at Columbia Records\' 30th Street Studio in New York City. On March 2, the tracks ""So What"", ""Freddie Freeloader"", and ""Blue in Green"" were recorded for side one of the original LP, and on April 22 the tracks ""All Blues"", and ""Flamenco Sketches"" were recorded, making up side two. Production was handled by Teo Macero, who had produced Davis\'s previous two LPs, and Irving Townsend.\n\nAs was Miles Davis\'s penchant, he called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only ""Flamenco Sketches"" yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate track. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to ""Freddie Freeloader"" was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues of Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue, Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist\'s feelings, and also to take advantage of Kelly\'s superior skills as both bluesman and accompanist, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album\'s most blues-oriented number, ""Freddie Freeloader"". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958 reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of a Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.\n\nKind of Blue is based entirely on modality in contrast to Davis\'s earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and improvisation. The entire album was composed as a series of modal sketches, in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style. This style was in contrast to more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies.\n\nModal jazz of this type was not unique to this album. Davis himself had previously used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the \'58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans\'s third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell\'s methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled ""thick"". Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, ""a return to melody."" In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the simple chord progression predominant in bebop, stating ""No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don\'t have to worry about changes and you can do more with the  line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you\'re based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there\'s nothing to do but repeat what you\'ve just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them.""\n\nReleased \tAugust 17, 1959\nRecorded \tMarch 2 and April 22, 1959   (New York, New York)\nGenre \tJazz\nLength \t45:44\nLabel \tColumbia\nProducer \tTeo Macero\nIrving Townsend\n\n    * Miles Davis – trumpet, leader\n    * Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley – alto saxophone, except on ""Blue in Green""\n    * John Coltrane – tenor saxophone\n    * Wynton Kelly – piano, only on ""Freddie Freeloader""\n    * Bill Evans – piano on all, except ""Freddie Freeloader"", liner notes\n    * Paul Chambers – bass\n    * Jimmy Cobb – drums\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Kind+of+Blue"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Two of the highlights, ""Living for the City"" and ""Too High,"" make an especially deep impression thanks to Stevie\'s narrative talents; on the first, an eight-minute mini-epic, he brings a hard-scrabble Mississippi black youth to the city and illustrates, via a brilliant dramatic interlude, what lies in wait for innocents. (He also uses his variety of voice impersonations to stunning effect.) ""Too High"" is just as stunning, a cautionary tale about drugs driven by a dizzying chorus of scat vocals and a springing bassline. ""Higher Ground,"" a funky follow-up to the previous album\'s big hit (""Superstition""), and ""Jesus Children of America"" both introduced Wonder\'s interest in Eastern religion. It\'s a tribute to his genius that he could broach topics like reincarnation and transcendental meditation in a pop context with minimal interference to the rest of the album. Wonder also made no secret of the fact that ""He\'s Misstra Know-It-All"" was directed at Tricky Dick, aka Richard Milhouse Nixon, then making headlines (and destroying America\'s faith in the highest office) with the biggest political scandal of the century. Putting all these differing themes and topics into perspective was the front cover, a striking piece by Efram Wolff portraying Stevie Wonder as the blind visionary, an artist seeing far better than those around him what was going on in the early \'70s, and using his astonishing musical gifts to make this commentary one of the most effective and entertaining ever heard. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/Innervisions"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Run for Your Life"" – 2:18\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nMusically, the Beatles broadened their sound, most notably with influences drawn from the contemporary folk-rock of the Byrds and Bob Dylan. The album also saw the Beatles broadening rock n\' roll\'s instrumental resources, most notably on Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown). Although both the Yardbirds and the Kinks had used Indian influences in their music, this track is generally credited as being the first pop recording to use an actual sitar, an Indian stringed instrument, and Norwegian Wood sparked a musical craze for the sound of the novel instrument in the mid-Sixties. George Harrison soon became fanatically interested in the genre and began taking sitar lessons from renowned Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar. A broadening use of percussive arrangements, led by Ringo Starr\'s backbeats and frequently augmented by maracas and tambourine, can also be heard throughout the album, showcased in tracks such as Wait and Think For Yourself.\n\nRecording innovations were also made during the recording of the album—for instance, the keyboard solo in In My Life sounds like a harpsichord, but was actually played on a piano. George Martin found he could not match the tempo of the song while playing in this baroque style, so he tried recording with the tape running at half-speed. When played back at normal speed during the mixdown, the sped-up sound gave the illusion of a harpsichord. Other production innovations included the use of electronic sound processing on many instruments, notably the heavily compressed and equalised piano sound on John Lennon\'s The Word; this distinctive effect soon became extremely popular in the genre of psychedelic music.\n\nLyrically, the album was a major progression. Though a smattering of earlier Beatles songs had expressed romantic doubt and negativity, the songs on Rubber Soul represented a pronounced development in sophistication, thoughtfulness, and ambiguity. In particular, the relationships between the sexes moved from simpler boy-girl love songs to more nuanced, even negative portrayals. Norwegian Wood, one of the most famous examples and often cited as the Beatles\' first conscious assimilation of the lyrical innovations of Bob Dylan, sketches a poetically ambiguous extramarital affair between the singer and a mysterious girl. Drive My Car serves as a satirical piece of reverse sexism. Songs like I\'m Looking Through You, You Won\'t See Me, and Girl express more emotionally complex, even bitter and downbeat portrayals of romance, and Nowhere Man was arguably the first Beatles song to move beyond a romantic subject (arguable because the song Help!, released earlier in 1965, also appears not to be specifically about a boy-girl relationship—the song takes the form of a general cry for ""help"" from the singer to another person, whose relationship to the singer remains unspecified. Even the line ""Now I find I need you like I\'ve never done before"", could be addressed to any close friend of the singer, not necessarily a romantic partner).\n\nAfter completing the album and the accompanying single We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper, the Beatles were exhausted from years of virtually non-stop recording, touring, and film work. They subsequently took a three-month break during the first part of 1966, and used this free time exploring new directions that would colour their subsequent musical work. These became immediately apparent in the next album, Revolver.\n\nUntil very late in their career, the ""primary"" version of the Beatles\' albums was always the monophonic mix. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the group, producer George Martin, and the Abbey Road engineers devoted most of their time and attention to the mono mixdowns, and the band were usually all present throughout these sessions and actively participated in them. Even with their landmark Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band LP, the stereo mixdowns were considered less important than the mono version and were completed in far less time than the mono mixdown.\n\nWhile the stereo version of the original release of Rubber Soul was similar to that of their earliest albums, featuring mainly vocals on the right channel and instruments on the left, it was not produced in the same manner. The early albums were recorded on twin-track tape, and they were intended only for production of monaural records, so they kept vocals and instruments separated allowing the two parts to later be mixed in proper proportion. By this time, however, the Beatles were recording on four-track tape, which allowed a stereo master to be produced with vocals in the centre and instruments on both sides, as evidenced in their prior albums Beatles for Sale and Help!. But Martin was looking for a way to easily produce a stereo album which sounded good on a monaural record player. In what he admits was some experimentation, he mixed down the four-track master tape to stereo with vocals on the right, instruments on the left, and nothing in the middle.\n\nThe song Wait was initially recorded for, and then left off, the album Help!. The reason the song was released on Rubber Soul was that album that was one song short, and with the Christmas deadline looming, the Beatles chose to release Wait instead of recording a new composition.\n\nPaul McCartney claims to have conceived the album\'s title after overhearing a black musician\'s description of Mick Jagger\'s singing style as ""plastic soul"". John Lennon confirmed this in a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, stating, ""That was Paul\'s title... meaning English soul. Just a pun."" Also, Paul says the words ""Plastic soul, man. Plastic soul..."" at the end of I\'m Down take 1, on Anthology 2.\n\n\nAlbum artwork\n \nThe photo of the Beatles on the Rubber Soul cover appears stretched. McCartney relates the story behind this in Volume 5 of the documentary film Anthology. Photographer Bob Freeman had taken some pictures of the Beatles at Lennon\'s house. Freeman showed the photos to the Beatles by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, ""Ah! Can we have that? Can you do it like that?"" Freeman said he could.\n\nCapitol Records used a different colour saturation for the US version, causing the orange lettering used by Parlophone Records to show up as different colours. On some Capitol LP\'s, the title looks rich chocolate brown; others, more like gold. Yet on the official 1987 CD of the British version, the Capitol logo is visible, and the letters are not brown, nor the official orange, but a distinct green. The lettering was designed by Charles Front.\n\n\nRelease details\n\nThere were two different stereo versions released on vinyl in the US: the standard US stereo mix, and the ""Dexter Stereo"" version (a.k.a. the ""East Coast"" version), which has a layer of reverb added to the entire album. The standard US stereo mix and the original mono mix are available on CD as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 box set.\n\n\nUS release\n\nRubber Soul came out in the United States three days after the British release, and began its 59-week long chart run on Christmas Day. It topped the charts for six weeks from 8 January 1966, before dropping back. The album sold 1.2 million copies within nine days of its release, and to date has sold over four million copies in America.\n\nLike other pre-Sgt. Pepper Beatles albums, Rubber Soul differed markedly in its US and UK configurations; indeed, through peculiarities of sequencing, the US Rubber Soul was deliberately reconfigured to appear a folk rock album to angle the Beatles into that nascent and lucrative American idiom during 1965, thanks to the addition of I\'ve Just Seen a Face and It\'s Only Love (leftovers from the UK Help!) and the deletion of some of the more upbeat tracks (Drive My Car, Nowhere Man, If I Needed Someone, and What Goes On). The tracks missing on the US version would later surface on the Yesterday... and Today collection. The track variation resulted in a shorter album length, clocking in at 29:59. In addition, the stereo mix sent to the US from England has what are commonly called ""false starts"" at the beginning of I\'m Looking Through You. The track is also slightly shorter at the end. The false starts are on every American copy of the album from 1965 to 1990 and are also on the CD boxed set, The Capitol Albums Vol. 2. The US version of The Word is also recognizably different.\n\n\nCD release\n\nThe album was released on CD in the UK and US in April 1987, using the 14-song UK track lineup. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the 14 track UK version of the album was issued on LP and cassette on July 21, 1987. As with the CD release of the 1965 Help! album, the Rubber Soul CD featured a contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared by George Martin. This remix is somewhat controversial among Beatle fans — many purists prefer the 1965 mix. Strangely, a few Canadian-origin CD editions of Rubber Soul and Help! accidentally use the original mix of the album, presumably due to a mix-up.\n\n\nReception\n\nThe album was commercially successful, beginning a 42-week run in the British charts on 11 December 1965. On Christmas Day replaced Help!—The Beatles\' previous album—at the top of the charts, a position Rubber Soul held for eight weeks. The album was a major artistic leap for the group, and is often cited by critics, as well as members of the band, as the point at which the Beatles\' earlier Merseybeat sound began to be transformed into the eclectic, sophisticated pop/rock of their later career. John Lennon later said this was the first album on which the Beatles were in complete creative control during recording, with enough studio time to develop and refine new sound ideas. The US version of the album also greatly influenced The Beach Boys\' Brian Wilson, who ""answered"" the album by releasing Pet Sounds in 1966. The album became a classic—on 9 May 1987, it returned to the album charts for three weeks, and ten years later made another comeback to the charts.\n\nRubber Soul is often cited as one of the greatest albums in pop music history. In 1998, Q magazine readers voted it the 40th greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2001, VH1 placed it at number 6. In 2003, the album was ranked number 5 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, the album was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Rubber+Soul"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is named after a slang term for high-grade marijuana, and its cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure from hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute, and consequently features both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A-member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.\n\nUpon its release, The Chronic received positive reviews from most music critics and earned considerable sales success. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold over three million copies, which led to Dr. Dre becoming one of the top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre\'s production has been noted for founding and popularizing the G-funk sub-genre within gangsta rap. The Chronic has been widely regarded as one of the most important and influential albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip hop albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 138 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/The+Chronic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas and Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia between July and August 1980 and was produced by the quartet\'s long-time collaborator Brian Eno.\n\nFollowing the release of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of the group as a mere vehicle for frontman and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.\n\nByrne initially struggled with writer\'s block, but soon adopted a scattered stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for Remain in Light was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\'s computers and design company M&Co. Talking Heads expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side-projects. The album was the last of the band\'s collaborations with Eno, though Eno and Byrne\'s My Life in the Bush of Ghosts would be released the following year.\n\nRemain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and cohesive merging of disparate genres. The album peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 in the US and at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Remain in Light: ""Once in a Lifetime"" and ""Houses in Motion"". The record was certified Gold in the US and in Canada during the 1980s. It has been featured in several publications\' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and the best albums of all time, and it is often considered Talking Heads\' magnum opus. In 2006, it was remastered and reissued with the addition of four unfinished outtakes. The Library of Congress deemed the album ""culturally, historically, or artistically significant"", and selected it for preservation in their National Recording Registry in 2017. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/Remain+in+Light"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was eventually certified platinum and gold in the UK and US respectively. The only single from the record, ""Starman"", charted at number ten in the UK while peaking at the sixty-fifth spot in the US.\n\nIn 1997, Ziggy Stardust was named the 20th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 24 and Virgin All-time Top 1000 Albums ranked it at number 11, while in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 48. It was named the 35th best album ever made by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q placed it at number 25 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2004 it was placed at number 81 in Pitchfork Media\'s Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In his 1995 book, ""The Alternative Music Almanac,"" Alan Cross placed the album in the #3 spot on the list of \'10 Classic Alternative Albums\'. In 2006, the album was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.\n\nIn 2005, Seu Jorge did a cover album of 14 Bowie songs, many of them from Ziggy Stardust, as a soundtrack for the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou called The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions. The translation into Portuguese is not always exact, as Seu Jorge maintains the melodies and styles, but often varies the lyrics. Musician Saul Williams named his 2007, Trent Reznor produced album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, clearly in a nod to Bowies album.\n\nBowie claimed that the name came from a tailor\'s shop in London called Ziggy\'s. Bowie later told Rolling Stone it was ""one of the few Christian names I could find beginning with the letter \'Z\'."" ""Stardust"" comes from one of Bowie\'s labelmates, a country singer named Norman Carl Odam, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Bowie covered a Legendary Stardust Cowboy song, ""I Took a Trip (On a Gemini Spaceship)"" thirty years later on Heathen.\n\nThe Ziggy Stardust sessions began just a few weeks after Hunky Dory was released. The first song recorded for the album, the cover ""It Ain\'t Easy,"" was recorded in September 1971. The first session in November produced ""Hang on to Yourself,"" ""Ziggy Stardust,"" ""Rock \'n\' Roll Star"" (later shortened to ""Star""), ""Moonage Daydream,"" ""Soul Love,"" ""Lady Stardust,"" and ""Five Years.""\n\nAlso recorded during the November Ziggy Sessions were two more cover songs intended for the as-yet untitled album. They were Chuck Berry\'s ""Around and Around"" (re-titled ""Round and Round"") and Jacques Brel\'s ""Amsterdam"" (re-titled ""Port of Amsterdam""). A re-recording of ""Holy Holy"" (first recorded in 1970 and released as a single, to poor sales, in January 1971) was initially slated for Ziggy, but was dropped in favour of ""Rock \'n\' Roll Suicide."" ""Round and Round"" was replaced by ""Starman"" and ""It Ain\'t Easy"" replaced ""Amsterdam"" on the album\'s final running order. All three were eventually released as b-sides.\n\n""Velvet Goldmine,"" first recorded during the Hunky Dory sessions, was also intended for Ziggy, but was replaced by ""Suffragette City."" RCA released it in 1975 as the b-side to the UK re-release of ""Space Oddity"" after having it remixed and mastered without Bowie\'s approval.\n\nAfter recording some of the new songs for Sounds of the 70s with Bob Harris (which appear on Bowie at the Beeb) as the newly-dubbed Spiders from Mars in January-February 1972, the band returned to Trident. They recorded ""Starman,"" ""Suffragette City,"" and ""Rock \'n\' Roll Suicide"" by the end of the month.\n\n""Starman,"" released as a single in April (and not intended for the final album at first), has never appeared in its original ""loud"" mix on CD. It differs somewhat in that it ""features a subdued \'morse code\' section between the verse and the chorus"" compared to the original released in 1972. ""Starman""\'s b-side, ""Suffragette City,"" was mastered for the album with a three-note coda leading in from ""Ziggy Stardust"" to make the songs sound linked. They were never played as such by Bowie in concert.\n\nRecorded and released during the ensuing Ziggy tour were two other songs. The first, ""John, I\'m Only Dancing,"" was recorded at Trident in late June and released (in the UK only) in September. ""The Jean Genie,"" recorded at RCA Studios in New York in early October at the start of the American tour, was released in the U.S. in November. The song was remixed for Aladdin Sane.\n\nRock keyboardist Rick Wakeman was given the opportunity to play keyboards on the album but Rick opted to join the progressive rock group Yes instead.\n\nThe album was intended by Bowie to serve as the soundtrack and musical basis for a stage show and/or television production telling the story of Ziggy Stardust. As well as the songs on the album, Bowie also intended songs such as ""All the Young Dudes"", ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""Rock \'n\' Roll With Me"" (the latter two later recorded for Diamond Dogs) for this realization of the Ziggy story. In a Rolling Stone interview with William S. Burroughs, Bowie outlined the full plot of the Ziggy Stardust story:\n\n""The time is five years to go before the end of the earth. It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock-and-roll band and the kids no longer want rock-and-roll. There\'s no electricity to play it. Ziggy\'s adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, \'cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news. \'All the young dudes\' is a song about this news. It\'s no hymn to the youth as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\n\nThe end comes when the infinites arrive. They really are a black hole, but I\'ve made them people because it would be very hard to explain a black hole on stage.\n\nZiggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a Starman, so he writes \'Starman\', which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately...The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in Greenwich Village. They don\'t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black hole jumping. Their whole life is travelling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles Brando, another one is a Black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie, the Infinite Fox...Now Ziggy starts to believe in all this himself and thinks himself a prophet of the future starmen. He takes himself up to the incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his disciples. When the infinites arrive, they take bits of Ziggy to make them real because in their original state they are anti-matter and cannot exist in our world. And they tear him to pieces on stage during the song \'Rock \'n\' roll suicide\'. As soon as Ziggy dies on stage the infinites take his elements and make themselves visible.""\n\nThe more generally acknowledged story, however, has Ziggy Stardust himself being the ""starman"", from Mars, who has come to save the Earth with messages of love and peace, and Bowie has referred to Ziggy as a ""Martian"" in several interviews.\n\nSimple two-syllable phrases provide the spine for ""Suffragette City"" (""hey man""), ""Hang on to Yourself"" (""come on""), ""Lady Stardust"" (""all right""), and ""Five Years"" (""five years"").\n\n""Starman,"" the album\'s single, has been described as a cross between mod and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n1.

Brian Jones  performs on only two tracks, the autoharp on ""You Got the Silver"" and percussion on ""Midnight Rambler"". His replacement Mick Taylor also plays on two tracks, ""Country Honk"" and ""Live With Me.""  Keith Richards, who had already shared vocal duties with Mick Jagger on a handful of songs (""Connection"", ""Something Happened to Me Yesterday"" and ""Salt of the Earth""), sang his first solo lead vocal on a Rolling Stones recording with ""You Got the Silver.""\n\nDuring 1968, Richards had been hanging out in London with Gram Parsons, who had left The Byrds on the eve of their departure for a tour in the Republic of South Africa. By all accounts, Parsons had significant impact on Richards\' taste in country music, and perhaps as a result of his influence, the band recorded a true honky-tonk song, ""Country Honk,"" a more uptempo and rock and roll version of which would appear as their next single, ""Honky Tonk Women."" The LP track featured fiddle player Byron Berline, who worked with Parsons frequently throughout the latter\'s career. Parsons frequently took credit for the arrangement of ""Country Honk"", although both Jagger and Richards have stated that it was actually the original arrangement of the song as written and conceived while vacationing in Brazil in late 1968. In any event, Parsons had recently introduced the group to his cache of traditional country records and was at least indirectly responsible for this sea change. The singer\'s own cover, released on the 1976 rarities compilation Sleepless Nights, features a slightly different set of lyrics and yet another arrangement that combines elements of both Stones versions.\n\nRecorded under trying circumstance owing to the band having reached the final impasse with Jones, the album has been called a great summing up of the dark underbelly of the 1960s. In addition to being one of their all-time classics, Bleed is the second of the Stones\' run of four studio LPs that are generally regarded as among their greatest achievements artistically, equalled only by the best of their great 45s from that decade. The other three albums are  Beggars Banquet (1968),  Sticky Fingers(1971), and Exile on Main Street (1972). Steven Van Zandt said the albums represented the ""Second Great Era"" of the Rolling Stones and called it ""the greatest run of albums in history"".\n\nReleased in December, Let It Bleed reached #1 in the United Kingdom (temporarily knocking The Beatles\' Abbey Road  out of the top slot) and #3 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart in the United States, where it eventually went double platinum. The album was also critically well-received.\n\nIn 1998 Q magazine readers voted Let It Bleed the 69th greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 28 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed Let It Bleed at number 24 on their best album survey. In 2003, it was listed as number 32 on the List of Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nIn August 2002, this album was reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.\n\nCover\n\nThe cover displays a surreal sculpture designed by Robert Brownjohn. The image consists of the Let It Bleed record being played by the antique tone-arm of a turntable, which is fitted with a tall record-changer-style spindle supporting, in place of a stack of records, a number of items stacked on a dinner plate (bottom-to-top): a magnetic tape/movie reel canister labelled Stones - Let It Bleed; a clock face; a pizza; a small tyre; a cake with kitsch icing, reminiscent of art-deco-style plaster rendering; and the band itself in the form of wedding-style topping figures. The cake parts of the album cover construction were prepared by then unknown cookery writer Delia Smith. The artwork is inspired by the working title of the album, which was ""Automatic Changer"" (source: Bill Wyman, Rolling with the Stones).\n\nThe reverse of the LP sleeve shows the same ""record-stack"" melange partially ""consumed"", with a slice of the uppermost cake layer removed and the mini-Stones knocked over into the frosting; the tyre hacked and nailed, bandaged and patched; film stray from the tape/film canister; and the supporting plate chipped; a slice of pizza with a bite taken lies on the shattered vinyl; along with the detached tone-arm -- as if evidence of the aftermath of a wild party.\n\nThe inside of the album sleeve features the message ""This record should be played loud"".\n\nThe track listing on the record sleeve did not follow the tracklisting on the record. According to Brownjohn, he altered the track listing purely for visual reasons. The correct orders were shown on the record\'s label. When ABKCO first issued the album on CD in 1986, the CD track listing followed that of the LP sleeve, not the actual track order of the original album. This was corrected on the 2002 re-issue.\n\nPersonnel\n\n     Mick Jagger – vocals, backing vocals, harmonica\n     Keith Richards – acoustic, electric guitar, slide guitar, bass, vocals\n     Brian Jones – autoharp, percussion (congas)\n     Mick Taylor – electric guitar, slide guitar\n     Charlie Watts – drums\n     Bill Wyman – bass, autoharp, vibes\n\n     Ian Stewart – piano\n     Nicky Hopkins – piano, organ\n     Jimmy Miller – percussion, drums, tambourine\n     Merry Clayton – vocals, backing vocals on ""Gimme Shelter""\n     Ry Cooder – mandolin on ""Love in Vain""\n     Nanette Workman – backing vocals on ""Country Honk"" (not actress Nanette Newman as credited on the LP)\n     Byron Berline – fiddle on ""Country Honk""\n     Bobby Keys – tenor saxophone on ""Live with Me""\n     Leon Russell – piano and horn arangenment on ""Live with Me""\n     Al Kooper - piano, french horn, and organ on ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want""\n     Jack Nitzche - choral arrangements on ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want""\n     Rocky Dijon - percussion on ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want""\n\nThe song ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want"" also features The London Bach Choir, but the group asked to have its name removed from the album\'s credits. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Let+It+Bleed"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

OK Computer expanded the band\'s worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"" and ""No Surprises"".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead\'s later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album\'s artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote ""Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year."" Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album\'s release to the era\'s feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said ""It\'s as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves."" Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that ""the majority of OK Computer\'s 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It\'s a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul."" Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that ""Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I\'m betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era."" In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album ""is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen.""\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is ""a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes"", but warned ""OK Computer is not an easy listen."" An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that ""When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead\'s growing pains, though, their aim — to take British pop to a heavenly new level — is true."" In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead\'s risk-taking with the more musically conservative ""dadrock"" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that ""Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock."" Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that ""Radiohead\'s third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year\'s greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.""\n\nDespite OK Computer\'s widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B− but ranked it as the ""Dud of the Month"" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked ""soul"", calling it ""arid"" and ""ridiculous"" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, ""For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency"". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"", and ""Let Down"", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, ""While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers.""\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics\' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk\'s Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a ""best of all time"" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer\'s popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader\'s poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying ""Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering.""\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its ""despairing-yet-hopeful tone"" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the ""New Labour"" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with ""killing"" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that ""sound like us"" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of ""bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997"", Yorke replied ""Good luck with \'Kid A\'!"".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer—TV on the Radio\'s debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album\'s popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O\'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said ""When I heard \'OK Computer,\' after five minutes I said, \'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.\' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do."" Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead\'s best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released on September 24, 1991 through Jive Records, the album produced three singles; ""Check the Rhime"", ""Jazz (We\'ve Got)"", and ""Scenario"", and stands as one of hip hop’s greatest and most influential albums of all time.\n\nAfter A Tribe Called Quest\'s debut album, People\'s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990), Jarobi White left the group to study culinary art. Phife Dawg learned that he was diabetic a month after the album\'s release and after a discussion with fellow member Q-Tip, they agreed to increase his participation on their second album and to ""step it up in general as a group.""Q-Tip credited N.W.A\'s album Straight Outta Compton (1988) as an inspiration for the record. The group hired double bassist Ron Carter on the track ""Verses from the Abstract"". Q-Tip stated, ""We wanted that straight bass sound, and Ron Carter is one of the premier bassists of the century."" Carter agreed to record tracks on the condition that the group avoid profanity, to which Q-tip assured they were addressing ""real issues"".\n\nThe Low End Theory is stylistically reminiscent of mid-1980s hip hop. Producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad and rappers Q-Tip and Phife Dawg showcase how rap was done before commercial success influenced many rappers\' creativity. The album\'s minimalist sound is ""stripped to the essentials: vocals, drums, and bass."" The bass drum and vocals emphasize the downbeat on every track.\n\nThe Low End Theory helped shape alternative hip hop in the 1990s. It established the musical, cultural, and historical link between hip hop and jazz. Writer Oliver Wang called the album ""a consummate link between generations"", which took the essence of jazz and hip hop, and ""showing they originated from the same black center."" The group\'s ""mellow innovations"" helped jazz rap gain significant exposure from 1992 to 1993. Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 154 in ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", stating that ""people connected the dots between hip-hop and jazz -- both were revolutionary forms of black music based in improvisation and flow -- but A Tribe Called Quest\'s second album drew the entire picture.""\n\nIn Time magazine\'s ""ALL-TIME 100"" albums, Josh Tyrangiel called the record an exception to jazz rap often being ""wishful thinking on the part of critics"". He described the album as ""socially conscious without being dull"" and likened a few tracks to ""smoky rooms where cool guys ... say cool things.""Pitchfork Media listed the album at number fifty-six in its ""Top 100 Albums of the 1990s"". The Low End Theory was voted at number thirty-two in The Village Voice\'s 1991 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Allmusic writer John Bush, who declared it ""the most consistent and flowing hip-hop album ever recorded"", summed up the record as ""an unqualified success, the perfect marriage of intelligent, flowing raps to nuanced, groove-centered productions."" On February 1, 1995, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum, and the album is usually praised as the group\'s best work. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest/The+Low+End+Theory"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album remains one of the most widely celebrated albums in hip hop history, appearing on numerous best album lists by critics and publications.\n\nIts production was handled by Nas, Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S., and DJ Premier.

In 2006, the album was added to the United States National Recording Registry, along with another 24 significant recordings that year.\n\nComing at a time when Simon\'s musical career was at something of a low ebb following the disappointing public response to Hearts and Bones, the project was originally inspired by Simon\'s listening to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys instrumental ""Gumboots"", lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter with whom Simon was working (and who would later become an award-winning jingle singer and writer). Simon later wrote lyrics to sing over a re-recording of the song, which became the fourth track on the album.\n\nThe group Los Lobos appear on the last track, ""All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints."" According to Los Lobos\'s saxophone player Steve Berlin, Simon stole the song from Los Lobos, giving them no songwriting credit:\n\n    ""It was not a pleasant deal for us. I mean he  quite literally — and in no way do I exaggerate when I say — he stole the songs from us... We go into the studio, and he had quite literally nothing. I mean, he had no ideas, no concepts, and said, ""Well, let\'s just jam."" ...Paul goes, ""Hey, what\'s that?"" We start playing what we have of it, and it is exactly what you hear on the record. So we\'re like, ""Oh, ok. We\'ll share this song."" ...A few months later, the record comes out and says ""Words and Music by Paul Simon."" We were like, ""What the fuck is this?"" We tried calling him, and we can\'t find him. Weeks go by and our managers can\'t find him. We finally track him down and ask him about our song, and he goes, ""Sue me. See what happens.""\n\nPaul Simon answered: ""I just said at this stage I don\'t care whether the album comes out without Los Lobos on it. I was getting really tired of it—I don\'t want to get into a public slanging match over this, but this thing keeps coming up. So we finished the recordings. And three months passed, and there was no mention of \'joint writing.\' The album came out and we heard nothing. Then six months passed and Graceland had become a hit and the first thing I heard about the problem was when my manager got a lawyer\'s letter. I was shocked. They sent this thing to my manager, not me. If there was a problem, they could have contacted me direct. They\'ve got my home number; we talked a lot. If you ask me, it was a lawyer\'s idea. You know, \'The record\'s a hit, and there\'s $100,000 in it.\' They had nine months from the recordings to talk to me about all this, but I heard nothing. And it\'s still not sorted out, because they still keep bringing it up—I heard they\'d done this interview for you. I don\'t want to get into a public slanging match with them, because I really like their music.""\n\nGraceland was Paul Simon\'s highest charting album in the U.S. in over a decade, reaching #3 in the national Billboard charts, receiving a certification of 5× Platinum by the RIAA and eventually selling over 14 million copies, making it the singer\'s most commercially successful album. Critics welcomed its eclectic mix of sounds and broad, quirky subject matter and it regularly shows up in critic polls and ""recommended"" lists. The album also helped to draw worldwide attention to the music of South Africa.\n\nIn the Graceland Classic Albums video, Simon states that he considers the title track the best song he has ever written. A popular music video starring Simon and Chevy Chase was made for the hit song ""You Can Call Me Al"". Simon toured the album extensively, featuring many of the artists from the album in addition to exiled South Africans Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba. Two concerts in Harare, Zimbabwe, were filmed in 1987 for release as ""The African Concert"". The audience was a multi-racial mix with many travelling from South Africa.\n\nRankings:\n\n    * Voted the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll.\n    * In 1998, Q magazine readers voted it the 56th greatest album of all time.\n    * It was also ranked #84 in a 2005 survey held by British television\'s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n    * In 1989, it was rated #5 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the \'80s.\n    * It is #81 on the list of Rolling Stone magazine\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n    * The song ""Graceland"" was voted #485 in the list of Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n    * According to AcclaimedMusic.net, a site which combines hundreds of best-of lists from critics and musicians from around the world, Graceland is ranked at #66 on the greatest albums of all time. It is also ranked #13 for albums released in the 1980s, and it is the second-highest ranking album of 1986, behind The Smiths\' The Queen Is Dead).\n    * In 2002, Pitchfork Media named it the 85th best album of the 1980s.\n    * In 2006, Time named it one of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/Graceland"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, OutKast did not tone down the regional qualities, like the harmonica break on ""Rosa Parks"" and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. ""Rosa Parks"" was later nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song led to much controversy with Rosa Parks filing a defamation suit against OutKast.   Aquemini  also featured live instrumentation and poetic lyricism, such as the reggae horns on the seven-minute long ""SpottieOttieDopaliscious"" and wah-wah guitar on the closing track ""Chonkyfire"". The album also included West Savannah, which was an outtake from Outkast\'s debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. The track was also featured as an intro to the ""Benz Or Beamer"" video, but was held off Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik and not used on the duo\'s follow-up album ATLiens, finally to surface on this album. The song is the original version and was not re-recorded for the album. A small intro to the song begins at the end of Slump, with Big Boi referring to the song\'s history.\n\nLyrics\n\nDelivered with rhythmic vocal styles and distinctive Southern rapping, the main focus of the album seemed to be on morality. With complex metaphors and dirty South slang, Andre addresses his critics in the album opener, ""Return of the G"". It\'s the return of the gangsta/Thanks ta\' them niggas that think you soft/And say, ""Y\'all be gospel rappin\'"" /But they be steady clappin\'/When you talk about bitches and switches/And hoes and clothes and weed.... Aquemini\'s catchy lyrics are a mix of street-wise and common sense. RapReviews.com noted that ""Aquemini is full of small moments that make you nod your head and look forward to hearing them again.""   ""SpottieOttieDopaliscious"" featured a soulful hook by Sleepy Brown and introspective lyricism by Big Boi and Andre, reciting it in spoken word style.\n\nThe L.A. Times called Aquemini a ""brilliant slice of hip-hop"". It also received a ""classic"" ranking of 5 mics from The Source magazine, which later wrote of the album that it ""possesses an uncanny blend of sonic beauty, poignant lyricism and spirituality that compels without commanding"".  In a November 1998 article, What Magazine praised Aquemini, as they wrote:\n\n""OutKast\'s third album is the perfect concoction of spirituality, street reality and chunky Southern beats. On Aquemini, Atlanta\'s first soldiers have pointed their Cadillacs toward the Cosmos. Lyrically, Big Boi\'s street patter flawlessly complements Dre\'s increasingly abstract cerebral flow. While Big Boi keeps your feet firmly planted in reality, Dre drags your head through the many dimensions of the spiritual universe. The results are dangerous.""\n    —What Magazine\n\nSome critics appreciated the absence of a materialist focus. Rolling Stone declared that the album proved ""that you don\'t have to sell out to sell records"", while PopMatters agreed, claiming ""(i)n a year where excess was romanticized by nearly everyone, OutKast was one of the few commercial groups concerned with more than just \'the Benjamins\'"".  The music website Nude as the News called ""Rosa Parks"" ""one of the best rap songs ever crafted.""  The album was later ranked #21 on Chris Rock\'s list of the Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all time.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/OutKast/Aquemini"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and recalls almost nothing of the production.\n\nMusically, ""Station to Station"" was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, ""Young Americans"", while presenting a new direction towards synthesizers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as ""Kraftwerk"" and ""Neu!"". This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called ""Berlin Trilogy"", recorded with Brian Eno in 1977–79. Bowie himself has said that ""Station to Station"" was ""a plea to come back to Europe for me"". The album’s lyrics, meanwhile, reflected his preoccupations with Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion.\n\nWith its blend of funk and Krautrock, romantic balladry and occultism, ""Station to Station"" has been described as ""simultaneously one of Bowie\'s most accessible albums and his most impenetrable"". Featuring the single ""Golden Years"", it made the Top 5 in both the UK and US charts. In 2003, the album was ranked number 323 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Station+to+Station"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released as a double album, Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix\'s wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic ""Burning of the Midnight Lamp"", previously a U.K. single in the summer of 1967; the extended blues jam ""Voodoo Chile""; the New Orleans-style R&B; of Earl King\'s ""Come On""; the epic studio production of ""1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)""; the social commentary of ""House Burning Down""; and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding\'s ""Little Miss Strange"". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic ""All Along the Watchtower"", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan classic ""All Along the Watchtower"", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire.\n\nFollowing the first installment of recordings from Olympic Studios in London, including part of ""All Along the Watchtower"" and the aforementioned 1967 single, production moved during the spring of 1968 to the newly opened Record Plant Studios, situated close to Hendrix\'s favorite New York clubs. Recording there was by Jimi\'s favorite engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren. Despite a claim by Record Plant engineer Chris Stone that Kellgren engineered ""90%"" of Ladyland, the studio records show that most of the work was done by Kramer, only three tracks including the one by Redding having Kellgren as engineer.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, Hendrix fell out with producer Bryan ""Chas"" Chandler and Redding. Both of them grew tired with the undisciplined way Hendrix was working in the studio, because he was constantly inviting his friends and acquaintances in there. Chandler hated spending so much time in the studio and partly blamed it on these guests, but Jimi was determined to have his way. Chandler also complained that Hendrix\'s insistence on doing multiple takes of every song, combined with what he saw as Hendrix\'s drugged incoherence, led him to sell his share of the management company to his partner Michael Jeffery. Chandler quit in May 1968, leaving Hendrix sole producer on the project.\n\nHendrix\' studio perfectionism was legendary – he and Mitch Mitchell recorded well over 50 takes of ""Gypsy Eyes"" over three sessions, Hendrix was generally insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. Hendrix sang all the backing vocals himself on the title track and on ""Long Hot Summer Night"". He was said to be very happy with the vocal results on ""Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)"".\n\nMany of the album tracks show Hendrix\'s vision expanding far beyond the scope of the original trio and saw him collaborating with a range of outside musicians including Dave Mason, Chris Wood and Steve Winwood from Traffic; future Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles; Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady; former Dylan organist Al Kooper; and members of \'the Serfs\': Mike Finnegan on organ, Freddie Smith on saxophone, and Larry Faucette on congas. Cooperation between Hendrix and Redding, who was of the same opinion about time spent in the studio as Chandler, was strained during production. Hendrix plays bass on many tracks, including the bass solo on ""1983"". At times Hendrix recorded bass tracks simply to make things proceed faster. Redding plays acoustic guitar and sings lead vocals with Mitchell on ""Little Miss Strange"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/Electric+Ladyland"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their earlier work. Its themes explore conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating mental state of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett.\n\nDeveloped during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; the new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd\'s road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctive sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry. Storm Thorgerson designed the album\'s iconic sleeve; following keyboardist Richard Wright\'s request for a ""simple and bold"" design, it depicts a prism spectrum, representing the band\'s lighting and the record\'s themes.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was a commercial and critical success. It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained on the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd\'s most successful album and one of the best-selling worldwide. It has been remastered and re-released several times, and covered in its entirety by several acts. It produced two singles, ""Money"" and ""Us and Them."" It is often ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nBackground:\nFollowing Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan, and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason\'s home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters\' idea was for an album that dealt with things that ""make people mad,"" focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969\'s The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: ""I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.""\n\nGenerally, all four members agreed that Waters\' album concept unified by a single theme was a good idea. Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and production of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of ""  Breathe "" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of ""Us and Them"" borrowed from an original composition by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by The Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tones of the kit were transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that another band, Medicine Head, had already used that title it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premièred at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head\'s album, the title was changed back to the band\'s original preference. \n\nDark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – more than a year before its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as ""...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning."" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote, ""The ambition of Floyd\'s artistic intention is now vast."" Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: ""Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo."" However, the public praised the following tour. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version and the recorded version released a year later. Included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as ""On the Run,"" and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry\'s non-lexical vocal\'s on ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" The band\'s lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band traveled to France and recorded music for French director Barbet Schroeder\'s film, La Vallée. They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording the album, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete work on the album.\n\nConcept:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings but lacks the extended instrumental excursions, which, according to critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett\'s replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as ""that psychedelic noodling stuff"", and with Waters cited 1971\'s Meddle as a turning point towards what would be realized on the album. The Dark Side of the Moon\'s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett\'s deteriorating mental state; he had been the band\'s principal composer and lyricist. The album is notable for its use of musique concrète and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band\'s other work.\n\nEach side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) ""empathy."" ""Speak to Me"" and ""Breathe"" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one\'s own life – ""Don\'t be afraid to care."" By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental ""On the Run"" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular, Wright\'s fear of flying. ""Time"" examines the manner in which its passage can control one\'s life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in ""Breathe (Reprise)."" The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry\'s soulful metaphor for death, ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, ""Money,"" mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, ""Money"" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands). ""Us and Them"" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. ""Any Colour You Like"" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. ""Brain Damage"" looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line ""and if the band you\'re in starts playing different tunes"" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. The album ends with ""Eclipse"", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity while forcing the listener to recognize the common traits shared by humanity.\n\nRecording:\nThe album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973. The band was assigned staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as an assistant tape operator on Atom Heart Mother, and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles\' Abbey Road and Let It Be. The recording sessions made use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time; the studio was capable of 16-track mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes they had previously used, although the band often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.\n\nBeginning on 1 June, the first track to be recorded was ""Us and Them,"" followed six days later by ""Money."" Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife\'s pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band\'s decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album. (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). ""Time"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python\'s Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003, he said: ""We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on.""\n\nReturning from the US in January 1973, they recorded ""Brain Damage,"" ""Eclipse,"" ""Any Colour You Like"" and ""On the Run,"" while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions. A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on ""Brain Damage,"" ""Eclipse,"" and ""Time,"" and saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on ""Brain Damage,"" ""Us and Them"" and ""Money."" With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.\n\nInstrumentation:\nThe album features metronomic sound effects during ""Speak to Me,"" and tape loops opening ""Money."" Mason created a rough version of ""Speak to Me,"" at his home, before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backward, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of "" Breathe ."" Mason received a rare solo composing credit for ""Speak to Me.""\n\nThe sound effects on ""Money"" were created by splicing together Waters\' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which was used to create a 7-beat effects loop (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a ""walk around the room"" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album). At times, the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console\'s faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs (particularly ""On the Run"").\n\nAlong with the conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on ""Brain Damage"" and ""Any Colour You Like,"" and a Synthi A on ""Time"" and ""On the Run"". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio\'s echo chamber (during ""On the Run""), and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during ""Speak to Me,"" ""On the Run,"" ""Time,"" and ""Brain Damage."") This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on ""Time"" and ""On the Run."" ""Time"" features assorted clocks ticking and then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop, initially created the recordings as a quadraphonic test. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.\n\nVoices:\nSeveral tracks, including ""Us and Them"" and ""Time,"" demonstrated Richard Wright\'s and David Gilmour\'s ability to harmonize their voices. In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilized studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonize with himself. The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the quadraphonic mix of ""On the Run,"" when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener).\n\nThe album\'s credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing, one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright\'s composition ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album but was unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night, Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright\'s emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth and wanted to apologize to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. For her contribution, she was paid £30, equivalent to about £360 in 2018, but in 2004, she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. All post-2005 pressings, therefore, credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.\n\nSnippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album. During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as ""What\'s your favorite color?"" and ""What\'s your favorite food?"" before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). Questions such as ""When was the last time you were violent?"" Followed immediately by ""Were you on the right?"" Were answered in the order they were presented. Roger ""The Hat"" Manifold proved difficult to find and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied: ""...give \'em a quick, short, sharp shock..."" When asked about death he responded, ""live for today, gone tomorrow, that\'s me..."" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: ""I\'ve been mad for fucking years – absolutely years."" The band\'s road manager Peter Watts (father of actor Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during ""Brain Damage"" and ""Speak to Me."" His second wife, Patricia ""Puddie"" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the ""geezer"" who was ""cruisin\' for a bruisin\'"" used in the segue between ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"", and the words ""I never said I was frightened of dying"" heard halfway through ""The Great Gig in the Sky.""\n\nPerhaps the most notable responses ""I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do: I don\'t mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There\'s no reason for it – you\'ve got to go sometime"" and closing words ""there is no dark side in the moon, really."" As a matter of fact, it\'s all dark"" came from the studios\' Irish door attendant, Gerry O\'Driscoll. Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be ""trying too hard to be funny"", and were not included on the album. McCartney\'s Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line ""I don\'t know, I was really drunk at the time.""\n\nCompletion:\nFollowing the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide ""a fresh pair of ears."" Thomas\'s background was in music, rather than engineering. He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin and was acquainted with Pink Floyd\'s manager Steve O\'Rourke. All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a ""dry"" and ""clean"" mix, which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler, and more ""echoed"" mix. Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating, ""There was no difference in opinion between them, I don\'t remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun."" Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas\'s intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on ""Us and Them."" He was also present for the recording of ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" (Although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry). Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:\n\nWhen the record was finished, I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, ""This has obviously struck a chord somewhere"", and I was kind of pleased by that. You know when you\'ve done something, certainly, if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point, I thought to myself, ""Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work,"" and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.\n\nPackaging:\n“It felt like the whole band was working together. It was a creative time. We were all very open.”\n– Richard Wright\n\nThe album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band\'s previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as the band employed them. For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something ""smarter, neater – classier."" A photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell inspired the prism design.\n\nTheir associate, George Hardie, created the artwork. Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass prism dispersing light into color. The design represents three elements: the band\'s stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright\'s request for a ""simple and bold"" design. The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold – an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterward, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson\'s suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colors, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.\n\nSince the departure of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters. He is therefore credited as the author of the album\'s lyrics, making The Dark Side of the Moon the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited to him alone. The band was so confident of the quality of the words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album\'s sleeve. ""Roger\'s concerns in it are not out of date,"" remarked Gilmour on the album\'s twentieth anniversary. ""He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal than the rest of us, who had no great confidence in our lyric writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck with it: the roots of our problems were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with.""\nAs the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cutouts of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was presented through a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Maker\'s Roy Hollingworth described side one as ""so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow"", but praised side two, writing: ""The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night."" Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: ""I don\'t care if you\'ve never heard a note of the Pink Floyd\'s music in your life; I\'d unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon ."" In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side ""a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites but demands involvement."" In his 1981 review of the album, Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious but called it a ""kitsch masterpiece"" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry\'s saxophone, and studio effects, which enhance Gilmour\'s guitar solos.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973, the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LP\'s & Tape chart\'s number one spot on 28 April 1973 and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.\n\nLabel:\nMuch of the album\'s early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd\'s US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band\'s 1971 studio album Meddle. Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O\'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd was obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon\'s enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of ""Us and Them"" and ""Time."" In some countries – notably the UK – Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968\'s ""Point Me at the Sky"", and unusually ""Money"" was released as a single on 7 May, with ""Any Colour You Like"" on the B-side. It reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word ""bullshit"" removed from the song – leaving ""bull"" in its place – however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with ""Time"" on one side, and ""Us and Them"" on the opposite side. Menon\'s efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain, however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).\n\nSales:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon became one of the best-selling albums of all time and is in the top 25 of a list of best-selling albums in the United States. Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained on the Billboard album chart for 741 weeks. The album re-appeared on the Billboard charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in May 1991 and has been a perennial feature since then. In the UK, it is the seventh-best-selling album of all time and the highest selling album never to reach number one.\n\n “...I think that when it was finished, everyone thought it was the best thing we\'d ever done to date, and everyone was very pleased with it, but there\'s no way that anyone felt it was five times as good as Meddle, or eight times as good as Atom Heart Mother, or the sort of figures that it has in fact sold. It was...not only about being a good album but also about being in the right place at the right time.”\n– Nick Mason\n\nIn the US, the LP was released before the introduction of platinum awards on 1 January 1976. It, therefore, held only a gold disc until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11× platinum. On 4 June 1998 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 15× platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States – making it their biggest-selling work there (The Wall is 23× platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5 million). ""Money"" has sold well as a single, and as with ""Time"", remains a radio favorite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, ""Time"" was played on 13,723 occasions, and ""Money"" on 13,731 occasions. Industry sources suggest that worldwide sales of the album total about 45 million. ""On a slow week"" between 8,000 and 9,000 copies are sold, and a total of 400,000 were sold in 2002, making it the 200th-best-selling album of that year – nearly three decades after its initial release. The album has sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for Billboard. To this day, it occupies a prominent spot on Billboard\'s Pop Catalog Chart. It reached number one when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000 copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006, The Dark Side of the Moon achieved a combined total of 1,716 weeks on the Billboard 200 and Pop Catalog charts. One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of 50 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy. Upon a chart rule change in 2009 allowing catalog titles to re-enter the Billboard 200, The Dark Side of the Moon returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, reaching 900 weeks on the chart in April 2015.\n\n""The combination of words and music hit a peak,"" explained Gilmour. ""All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it\'s become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said we would never top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms.""\n\nRe-issues and remastering:\nIn 1979, The Dark Side of the Moon was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their ""Ultradisc"" gold CD format. The album was released by EMI on the then-new compact disc format in 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set Shine On. This version was re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover. On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles\' ""Ticket to Ride"" can be heard after ""Eclipse"" over the album\'s closing heartbeats.\n\nThe original quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album\'s 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons\' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1 channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters\' In the Flesh for SACD. Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie\'s SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was ""possibly a little too true to the original mix"", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003 and has since sold more than 800,000 copies. A team of designers including Storm Thorgerson created the cover image. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colors of the original. The idea is derived from the ""sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound ..."" The image was created out of a desire to be ""the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognizable prism design, but was different and hence new.""\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th-anniversary poster. In 2007, the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? A campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other materials.\n\nLegacy:\n“It\'s changed me in many ways, because it\'s brought in a lot of money, and one feels very secure when you can sell an album for two years. But it hasn\'t changed my attitude to music. Even though it was so successful, it was made in the same way as all our other albums, and the only criterion we have about releasing music is whether we like it or not. It was not a deliberate attempt to make a commercial album. It just happened that way. We knew it had a lot more melody than previous Floyd albums, and there was a concept that ran all through it. The music was easier to absorb and having girls singing away added a commercial touch that none of our records had.”\n– Richard Wright\n\nThe success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: ""I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn\'t.""\n\nPart of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs, and even in modern urban myths. Its release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Pink Floyd and Radiohead. – Specifically, their 1997 album OK Computer – which has been called The Dark Side of the Moon  of the 1990s, owing to the fact that both albums share themes relating to the loss of a creative individual\'s ability to function in the modern world. \n\nRankings:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all-time. In 1987, Rolling Stone listed the record 35th on its ""Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years,"" and sixteen years later, in 2003 the album polled in 43rd position on the magazine\'s list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time."" In 2012, The Dark Side of the Moon was voted 43rd again on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". In 2006, it was voted ""My Favourite Album"" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\'s audience. NME readers voted the album eighth in their 2006 ""Best Album of All Time"" online poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted the album the ""greatest of all time."" The album is also number two on the ""Definitive 200"" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers ""in celebration of the art form of the record album."" It came 29th in The Observer\'s 2006 list of ""The 50 Albums That Changed Music,"" and 37th in The Guardian\'s 1997 list of the ""100 Best Albums Ever,"" as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. The album\'s cover has been lauded by critics and listeners alike, VH1 proclaiming it the fourth greatest in history, and Planet Rock listeners the greatest of all time. In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album.\n\nCovers, tributes, and samples:\nOne of the more notable covers of The Dark Side of the Moon is Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd. Released in 2006, the album is a progressive rock tribute featuring artists such as Adrian Belew, Tommy Shaw, Dweezil Zappa, and Rick Wakeman. In 2000, The Squirrels released The Not So Bright Side of the Moon, which features a cover of the entire album. The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released Dub Side of the Moon in 2003 and Dubber Side of the Moon in 2010. The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella, a complete a cappella version of the album. The bluegrass band Poor Man\'s Whiskey frequently plays the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite Dark Side of the Moonshine. A string quartet version of the album was released in 2004. In 2009, The Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians. Industrial metal band Ministry called their seventh studio album Dark Side of the Spoon as a play of word to The Dark Side of the Moon with reference to heroin, as several members of the band suffered from long-term addiction to said substance at the time.\n\nSeveral notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers has used samples from The Dark Side of the Moon in their own material. Jam-rock band Phish performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part their show on 2 November 1998 in West Valley City, Utah. Progressive metal band Dream Theater has twice covered the album in their live shows, and in May 2011 Mary Fahl released From the Dark Side of the Moon, a song-by-song ""re-imagining"" of the album. Milli Vanilli used the tape loops from Pink Floyd\'s ""Money"" to open their track ""Money"", followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch of Music for the People.\n\nDark Side of the Rainbow:\nMain article: Dark Side of the Rainbow\nDark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are two names commonly used in reference to rumors (circulated on the Internet since at least 1994) that The Dark Side of the Moon was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric ""no one told you when to run"" during ""Time,"" and Dorothy balancing on a tightrope fence during the line ""balanced on the biggest wave"" in ""Breathe."" David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters have described the rumors as ""amusing."" Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during a production of the album.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

What had been hinted at on the intriguing project Music of My Mind was here focused into a laser beam of tight songwriting, warm electronic arrangements, and ebullient performances -- altogether the most realistic vision of musical personality ever put to wax, beginning with a disarmingly simple love song, ""You Are the Sunshine of My Life"" (but of course, it\'s only the composition that\'s simple). Stevie\'s not always singing a tender ballad here -- in fact, he flits from contentment to mistrust to promise to heartbreak within the course of the first four songs -- but he never fails to render each song in the most vivid colors. In stark contrast to his early songs, which were clever but often relied on the Motown template of romantic metaphor, with Talking Book it became clear Stevie Wonder was beginning to speak his mind and use personal history for material (just as Marvin Gaye had with the social protest of 1971\'s What\'s Going On). The lyrics became less convoluted, while the emotional power gained in intensity. ""You and I"" and the glorious closer ""I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever)"" subtly illustrate that the conception of love can be stronger than the reality, while ""Tuesday Heartbreak"" speaks simply but powerfully: ""I wanna be with you when the nighttime comes / I wanna be with you till the daytime comes."" Ironically, the biggest hit from Talking Book wasn\'t a love song at all; the funk landmark ""Superstition"" urges empowerment instead of hopelessness, set to a grooving beat that made it one of the biggest hits of his career. It\'s followed by ""Big Brother,"" the first of his directly critical songs, excoriating politicians who posture to the underclass in order to gain the only thing they really need: votes. With Talking Book, Stevie also found a proper balance between making an album entirely by himself and benefiting from the talents of others. His wife Syreeta and her sister Yvonne Wright contributed three great lyrics, and Ray Parker, Jr. came by to record a guitar solo that brings together the lengthy jam ""Maybe Your Baby."" Two more guitar heroes, Jeff Beck and Buzzy Feton, appeared on ""Lookin\' for Another Pure Love,"" Beck\'s solo especially giving voice to the excruciating process of moving on from a broken relationship. Like no other Stevie Wonder LP before it, Talking Book is all of a piece, the first unified statement of his career.

The album combines elements of heavy metal, punk rock, hard rock, and blues-rock.\n\nAppetite for Destruction reached number one on the US Albums Chart, and has since certified 15x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album has accumulated worldwide sales in excess of 28 million. Appetite for Destruction is ranked the fourth best-selling debut album in the United States. The album is considered by many to be one of the greatest hard rock albums of the 20th century.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nWhile the songwriting credits are indiscriminately credited to all five band members, many of the songs began as solo tracks that individual band members wrote in the pre-Guns N\' Roses era, only to be completed by the band. These songs include It\'s So Easy and Nightrain (McKagan), Mr. Brownstone, Anything Goes, and Think About You (Stradlin). Paradise City and Rocket Queen were unfinished Rose/McKagan and Rose/Stradlin demos respectively that the band wrote in their early career.\n\nOther songs on the album reflect the band\'s reaction to the debauchery of the L.A. rock and roll underground, such as Welcome to the Jungle (Rose wrote the lyrics while in Seattle about an incident in New York City) and Out ta Get Me, as well as their assorted female companions, reflected in the songs Sweet Child o\' Mine, Think About You, My Michelle, You\'re Crazy, and Rocket Queen.\n\n\nCover art\n\nThe album\'s original cover, based on the Robert Williams painting ""Appetite for Destruction"", depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. After several music retailers refused to stock the album, they compromised and put the controversial cover art inside, replacing it with a cover depicting a cross and skulls of the five band members (designed by William White, originally as a tattoo), each skull representing one member of the band: Izzy Stradlin, top skull; Steven Adler, left skull; Axl Rose, center skull; Duff McKagan, right skull; and Slash, bottom skull. The photographs used for the back of the album and liner notes were taken by Robert John (photographer).\n\n\nAchievements\n\n\nIn 1989 Rolling Stone ranked Appetite for Destruction as the 27th best album of the 1980s.\nThe same magazine later ranked it at sixty-one on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nIn 2001, Q magazine named Appetite for Destruction as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time.\nIn 2003, VH1 named Appetite for Destruction the 42nd Greatest Album of All Time.\nIt was ranked 18 in Spin magazine\'s 100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005.\nKerrang! magazine recently compiled a 100 Greatest Rock Albums Ever list of which Appetite for Destruction was ranked #1.\nIn 2004 the album was voted number 1 by fans in Metal Hammer magazine\'s greatest albums of all time list. Rolling Stone recently devoted their cover to the album\'s 20th Anniversary, July 2007.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/Appetite+for+Destruction"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It received rave reviews from publications such as USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. It was also voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll. In 2003, the album was ranked number 359 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nStank, a commonly used word on the album, is derived from a southern U.S. pronunciation of stink, the original meaning of the word funk. George Clinton applied the term stank to the more carnal, hedonistic things in life, including funk music. ""Stankonia"" is the name of a fictional land at ""the center of the earth, seven light years below sea level"", which is ""the place from which all \'funky thangs\' come"", according to the album\'s opening lyrics. The lyrical content is divided between verses from Big Boi and André 3000. The artists describe themselves as ""a player and a poet"", respectively, and this is reflected in the lyrics; Big Boi tends to deal with standard gangsta fare (such as guns, hoes, and pimping on songs such as ""Snappin & Trappin"" and ""We Luv Deez Hoez"") while André 3000 talks about other elements of ""stanking"", using metaphors  about elephants, ski slopes, and the four humours.\n\nPart of the reason for Stankonia\'s acclaim and popularity was the diversity of its musical influences, which led to comparisons to Prince. It incorporates many musical genres to create a unique-sounding whole. For example, the album opens with Indian tablas and harmonium, then launching into a heavy metal-style electric guitar riff on ""Gasoline Dreams"" before turning to slick P-funk on the second song (fourth track overall) ""So Fresh, So Clean"". The album also incorporates influences from gospel, (""Toilet Tisha""), samba (""Humble Mumble"") and drum and bass (""B.O.B.""). This stylistic diversity was tied together by the pseudo-psychedelic production, emphasizing trippy synthesizers, spacey sound effects, techno-tinged percussion, and weird 70s-style psychedelic funk, updated in a more contemporary hip-hop context. The album\'s cover is an homage to Sly & the Family Stone\'s There\'s a Riot Goin\' On.\n\nIts limited edition artwork features a computer-generated image of a subset of the Mandelbrot set, a fractal.\n\nRobert Christgau of The Village Voice gave it an A rating and described Stankonia  as ""comic and expansive P-Funk"". Allmusic  gave the album 5 out of 5 stars and wrote ""given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it\'s striking how few weak tracks there are"". Entertainment Weekly\'s Ken Tucker wrote that ""Stankonia  reeks of artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill"" and gave the album an A rating. Stankonia places as the 4th best ranked album of this century on Metacritic  with a score of 95, indicating universal acclaim.\n\nIn 2006, Time magazine named Stankonia as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2009, Pitchfork Media ranked Stankonia #13 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, and Rhapsody ranked it at #2 on its ""100 Best Albums of the Decade"" list. Rhapsody also ranked the album #6 on its ""Hip-Hop’s Best Albums of the Decade"" list. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade ""best-of"" list, saying, ""With hummable hits (\'Ms. Jackson\') and out-there experiments (\'B.O.B.\'), the rap duo gave us all a visa to the funky if fictional land of Stankonia in 2000."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/OutKast/Stankonia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded at the end of 1964, Trane\'s classic quartet of Elvin Jones, McCoy Tyner, and Jimmy Garrison stepped into the studio and created one of the most thought-provoking, concise, and technically pleasing albums of their bountiful relationship (not to mention his best-selling to date). From the undulatory (and classic) bassline at the intro to the last breathy notes, Trane is at the peak of his logical yet emotionally varied soloing while the rest of the group is remarkably in tune with Coltrane\'s spiritual vibe. Composed of four parts, each has a thematic progression leading to an understanding of spirituality through meditation. From the beginning, ""Acknowledgement"" is the awakening of sorts that trails off to the famous chanting of the theme at the end, which yields to the second act, ""Resolution,"" an amazingly beautiful piece about the fury of dedication to a new path of understanding. ""Persuance"" is a search for that understanding, and ""Psalm"" is the enlightenment. Although he is at times aggressive and atonal, this isn\'t Trane at his most adventurous (pretty much everything recorded from here on out progressively becomes much more free, and live recordings from this period are extremely spirited), but it certainly is his best attempt at the realization of concept -- as the spiritual journey is made amazingly clear. A Love Supreme clocks in at just over 30 minutes, but if it had been any longer it could have turned into a laborious listen. As it stands, just enough is conveyed. It is almost impossible to imagine a world without A Love Supreme having been made, and it is equally impossible to imagine any jazz collection without it.\n\nJohn Coltrane Quartet: John Coltrane – tenor saxophone, bandleader; Jimmy Garrison – double bass; Elvin Jones – drums; McCoy Tyner – piano <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/A+Love+Supreme"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Strangely enough, Hounds of Love was no less complicated in its structure, imagery, and extra-musical references (even lifting a line of dialogue from Jacques Tourneur\'s Curse of the Demon for the intro of the title song) than The Dreaming, which had been roundly criticized for being too ambitious and complex. But Hounds of Love was more carefully crafted as a pop record, and it abounded in memorable melodies and arrangements, the latter reflecting idioms ranging from orchestrated progressive pop to high-wattage traditional folk; and at the center of it all was Bush in the best album-length vocal performance of her career, extending her range and also drawing expressiveness from deep inside of herself, so much so that one almost feels as though he\'s eavesdropping at moments during ""Running Up That Hill."" Hounds of Love is actually a two-part album (the two sides of the original LP release being the now-lost natural dividing line), consisting of the suites ""Hounds of Love"" and ""The Ninth Wave."" The former is steeped in lyrical and sonic sensuality that tends to wash over the listener, while the latter is about the experiences of birth and rebirth. If this sounds like heady stuff, it could be, but Bush never lets the material get too far from its pop trappings and purpose. In some respects, this was also Bush\'s first fully realized album, done completely on her own terms, made entirely at her own 48-track home studio, to her schedule and preferences, and delivered whole to EMI as a finished work; that history is important, helping to explain the sheer presence of the album\'s most striking element -- the spirit of experimentation at every turn, in the little details of the sound. That vastly divergent grasp, from the minutiae of each song to the broad sweeping arc of the two suites, all heavily ornamented with layered instrumentation, makes this record wonderfully overpowering as a piece of pop music. Indeed, this reviewer hadn\'t had so much fun and such a challenge listening to a new album from the U.K. since Abbey Road, and it\'s pretty plain that Bush listened to (and learned from) a lot of the Beatles\' output in her youth. Incidentally, those seeking to hear the full, exquisite sonic range of Hounds of Love (or any of Bush\'s pre-1990s albums, for that matter) should ignore the U.S.-made EMI America CDs and go for any of the British CD editions, either individually or in the This Woman\'s Work set; or, better still on Hounds of Love, the boxed edition with bonus tracks released in conjunction with EMI\'s 100th anniversary in 1997. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Hounds+of+Love"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The record was a massive hit, producing a US number one single in ""Heart of Gold"". Other songs returned to some usual Young themes: ""Alabama"" was ""an unblushing rehash of \'Southern Man\'""; ""Words (Between the Lines of Age)"" featured a lengthy guitar workout with the band; and ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" was a lament for great artists who had died of heroin addiction, particularly Danny Whitten of Crazy Horse. The album\'s success caught Young off guard and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. He would later write that ""Heart of Gold"" ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch.

Following the record\'s release, My Bloody Valentine were removed from their record label Creation Records due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields, a factor that was alleged to have contributed to the bankruptcy of the label. In the subsequent years, the group struggled to record a follow-up album and would eventually break up in 1997. Loveless would be their last full-length release for over two decades.\n\nSince its release, Loveless has been widely proclaimed by critics as among the best albums of the 1990s, as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre, and as a significant influence on various subsequent artists. The album was reissued as a two-CD set on Sony in May 2012, containing remastered editions of the original digital tape and a previously unreleased ½-inch analogue tape. The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013, Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\nA widespread critical success, The College Dropout was praised for West\'s production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music\'s balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. It earned the rapper several accolades including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been named by Time, Rolling Stone, and other publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn the years leading up to the album, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded The College Dropout over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.\n\nThe album\'s production was primarily handled by West and developed his ""chipmunk soul"" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch-shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West\'s own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; it also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West\'s lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.\n\nThe College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a massive commercial success, becoming West\'s best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014. The album was promoted with singles such as ""Through the Wire"", ""Jesus Walks"", ""All Falls Down"", and ""Slow Jamz"", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThis is also his worst project. 3/10 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/The+College+Dropout"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its dark, intimate subject material includes feminist themes of sex, monogamous love, and relationship issues, inspired by Beyoncé\'s desire to assert her full creative freedom.\n\nThe album\'s initial recording began in New York City, where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with electronic producer and rock musician Boots. Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material, which combined contemporary R&B with electronic and soul music. Throughout this period, the album\'s songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.\n\nBeyoncé was released digitally on the iTunes Store without prior announcement or promotion, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, earning Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album on the chart. The album sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store up to that point. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Beyoncé was globally the tenth-best-selling album of 2013. The album was reissued in November 2014 as part of a platinum edition, along with an extended play of new songs, and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. Part of the album was promoted on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour during the 2014 legs.\n\nBeyoncé received universal acclaim from critics upon release who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, vocal performance, as well as the album\'s surprise release strategy which was subsequently replicated by many artists. Beyoncé is generally considered one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 21st century, and was ranked 81st in Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/Beyonc%C3%A9"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was remastered and re-released in 1994, then again as part of the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC Remasters series in 2003 by George Marino. In addition, a DualDisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.\n\nAs of June 2011, the album has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide, making it tied for second highest-selling album of all time, the highest-selling album by a band (together with Pink Floyd\'s The Dark Side of the Moon), the best-selling hard rock album of all-time, and the best-selling album ever released by an Australian musical act. On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22x multi-platinum, recognizing sales of 22 million in the US, making it the sixth-highest-selling album in the US (fourth-highest at the time).

The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed In a Silent Way album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style.\n\nBitches Brew was Davis\'s first gold record, selling more than half a million copies. Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album\'s unconventional style and revolutionary sound. Later, Bitches Brew gained recognition as one of jazz\'s greatest albums and a progenitor of the jazz rock genre, as well as a major influence on rock and funk musicians. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album in 1971. In 1998, Columbia Records released The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, a four-disc box set that included the original album as well as the studio sessions through February 1970.\n\nRecording sessions took place at Columbia\'s 30th Street Studio over the course of three days in August 1969. Davis called the musicians to the recording studio on very short notice. A few pieces on Bitches Brew were rehearsed before the recording sessions, but at other times the musicians had little or no idea what they were to record. Once in the recording studio, the players were typically given only a few instructions: a tempo count, a few chords or a hint of melody, and suggestions as to mood or tone. Davis liked to work this way; he thought it forced musicians to pay close attention to one another, to their own performances, or to Davis\'s cues, which could change at any moment. On the quieter moments of ""Bitches Brew"", for example, Davis\'s voice is audible, giving instructions to the musicians: snapping his fingers to indicate tempo, or, in his distinctive whisper, saying, ""Keep it tight"" or telling individuals when to solo.\n\nDavis composed most of the music on the album. The two important exceptions were the complex ""Pharaoh\'s Dance"" (composed by Joe Zawinul) and the ballad ""Sanctuary"" (composed by Wayne Shorter). The latter had been recorded as a fairly straightforward ballad early in 1968, but was given a radically different interpretation on Bitches Brew. It begins with Davis and Chick Corea improvising on the standard ""I Fall in Love too Easily"" before Davis plays the ""Sanctuary"" theme. Then, not unlike Davis\'s recording of Shorter\'s ""Nefertiti"" two years earlier, the horns repeat the melody over and over while the rhythm section builds up the intensity. The issued ""Sanctuary"" is actually two consecutive takes of the piece. Despite his reputation as a ""cool"", melodic improviser, much of Davis\'s playing on this album is aggressive and explosive, often playing fast runs and venturing into the upper register of the trumpet. His closing solo on ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"" is particularly noteworthy in this regard. Davis did not perform on the short piece ""John McLaughlin"".\n\nThere was significant editing done to the recorded music. Short sections were spliced together to create longer pieces, and various effects were applied to the recordings. Enrico Merlin reports:\n\n    Bitches Brew also pioneered the application of the studio as a musical instrument, featuring stacks of edits and studio effects that were an integral part of the music. Miles and his producer, Teo Macero, used the recording studio in radical new ways, especially in the title track and the opening track, ""Pharaoh\'s Dance"". There were many special effects, like tape loops, tape delays, reverb chambers and echo effects. Through intensive tape editing, Macero concocted many totally new musical structures that were later imitated by the band in live concerts. Macero, who has a classical education and was most likely inspired by the 1930s and 1940s musique concrète experiments, used tape editing as a form of arranging and composition.\n\n    ""Pharaoh\'s Dance"" contains 19 edits – its famous stop-start opening is entirely constructed in the studio, using repeat loops of certain sections. Later on in the track there are several micro-edits: for example, a one-second-long fragment that first appears at 8:39 is repeated five times between 8:54 and 8:59. The title track contains 15 edits, again with several short tape loops of, in this case, five seconds (at 3:01, 3:07 and 3:12). Therefore, Bitches Brew not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nMiles Davis trumpet\nWayne Shorter ss, Bennie Maupin bcl, Joe Zawinul p\nLarry Young p, Chick Corea p, John McLaughlin g, \nDave Holland b, Harvey Brooks electric bass\nLenny White d, Jack DeJohnette d, Don Alias drums, congas\nJuma Santos shaker, congas\n\nMati Klarwein\'s painting on the cover \nReleased April 1970 - Recorded August 19-21.8. 1969\nProducer Teo Macero, Columbia  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Bitches+Brew"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On & On and Appletree the first two songs on Baduizm, illustrated her talent at singing soul with the qualities of jazz. With a nimble, melodic voice owing little to R&B from the past 30 years, she phrased at odds with the beat and often took chances with her notes. Like many in the contemporary rap world, though, she also had considerable talents at taking on different personas; ""Otherside of the Game"" is a poetic lament from a soon-to-be single mother who just can\'t forget the father of her child. Erykah Badu\'s revolution in sound -- heavier hip-hop beats over organic, conscientious soul music -- was responsible for her breakout, but many of the songs on Baduizm don\'t hold up to increased examination. For every intriguing track like ""Next Lifetime,"" there\'s at least one rote R&B jam like ""4 Leaf Clover."" Jazz fans certainly weren\'t confusing her with Cassandra Wilson -- Badu had a bewitching voice, and she treasured her notes like the best jazz vocalists, but she often made the same choices, the hallmark of a singer rooted in soul, not jazz. Though many fans would dislike (and probably misinterpret) the comparison, she\'s closer to Diana Ross playing Billie Holiday -- as she did in the 1972 film Lady Sings the Blues -- than Holiday herself. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Erykah+Badu/Baduizm"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Under pressure from their record company to follow-up the successful debut of their May 1967 album Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love was released on Track Records in the UK in December 1967. It reached #5 in the UK and later, #3 in the US.\n\nThe album was recorded to fulfill the band\'s contract, which stated that they must produce two albums in 1967. Even so, it was not released in the USA until 1968 due to fears that it might have disturbed the sales of the first album. Bassist Noel Redding has noted that this was his favourite of three Experience albums. He plays eight string bass on some tracks.\n\nJust before the album\'s completion, Hendrix left the master tapes of side 1 in a taxi. They were never found again, and thus the A-side had to be mixed again quickly.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 82 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nMany of the album\'s songs were composed with studio recording techniques in mind and as a result were rarely performed live. Only \'Spanish Castle Magic\' and \'Little Wing\' were performed regularly. The lyrics of ""Spanish Castle Magic"" were inspired by \'The Spanish Castle\', a dance hall in what is now Des Moines, Washington near Seattle where Hendrix jammed with local rock groups during his high school years. On \'Little Wing\' Hendrix plays his guitar through a Leslie speaker (a revolving speaker which creates a wavering effect, that is typically used with electric organs) for the first time. Hendrix\'s effects man Roger Mayer then invented the \'Univibe\' effects pedal to simulate the Leslie sound for him (the commercially sold Uni-Vibe pedal was made by Fumo Mieda an engineer of Shin-Ei company not Roger Mayer. Hendrix started using the Uni-Vibe in the summer of \'69 just shortly after the release of the Uni-Vibe. Jimi Hendrix also used the obscure and elusive Jax Vibra Chorus - basically a Uni-Vibe with the addition of tremolo and full/slow repeat time selector - on various recordings.)\n\nThe intro track, ""EXP"", begins with a few notes from \'Stone Free\' (although played one-half step down) and then features a conversation between Mitchell and Hendrix about UFOs, where Mitchell plays a radio host, and Hendrix plays an outerspace alien in the guise of a human named Mr. Paul Caruso, whose voice is gradually slowed down until he eventually takes off in his spaceship, much to the host\'s consternation (""But-but-but"", he splutters). Paul Caruso was actually a friend of Jimi\'s from his days in Greenwich Village. \'Up From the Skies\' is a jazzy number featuring Mitchell playing with brushes. The song is about a space alien who has visited the earth thousands of years in the past, and returns to the present to ""find the stars misplaced and the smell of a world, that has burned.""\n\n""Wait Until Tomorrow"" is a pop-song with an R&B guitar riff with Mitchell and Redding singing backing vocals. The fourth track, \'Ain\'t No Telling\', is a rock song with a complex structure despite its short length. \'Little Wing\', as Jimi himself said, was his impression of the Monterey Pop Festival put into the form of a girl. \'If 6 Was 9\', the last song on the A-side, is the album\'s longest track and arguably the most psychedelic; Gary Leeds (Walker Brothers) and Graham Nash use their feet during the outro to make some stomping. The song features prominently on the soundtrack for the 1969 counterculture film, \'Easy Rider\',as well as the Vietnam \'flashback\' film ""Apocalypse Now"" during the chaotic battle scene at the bridge.\n\n""You Got Me Floatin"", a rock song opening with a swirling backwards played guitar (which is absent on the mysterious, differently mixed Polydor version of this LP (only available in stereo), which outside of France & UK was the only one available in Europe, opens the second side of the album. Roy Wood and Trevor Burton from The Move, who toured with Hendrix on a package tour through Britain during winter 1967, supplied background vocals. The following track, \'Castles Made of Sand\', is a ballad also making use of a backwards guitar solo. \'She\'s so Fine\', Redding\'s contribution to the album as a composer, a very British Pop/Rock/Who influenced affair features Redding on lead vocals with help from Mitchell. \'One Rainy Wish\' begins as a ballad but develops a rock feel during the chorus that is in a different time signature than the verses.\n\nThe song \'Little Miss Lover\' was the first to feature a percussive muted wah-wah effect (with the fretboard hand ""killing"" notes) - a technique that was later adopted by many guitarists. The album is included in the book \'1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\'. Guitarist magazine named the album number seven on their list of ""the most influential guitar albums of all time"". The final song of the album, Bold as Love, opens very abruptly and segues into a mellow groove similar to Little Wing and Castles Made of Sand. With a psychedelic chorus and an extended solo at the end it fades out the album.\n\nHendrix was a little disappointed with the album\'s cover art. Although he appreciated the symbolic design, he mentioned in an interview that it would have been more appropriate if the cover art showcased his American ""Indian"" heritage. The British Track records art department had independently chosen to use the current fad for all things Indian to create the cover, and thus the album\'s cover has a photographed copy of a cheap, mass produced religious poster of the Hindu devotional painting known as \'Viraat Purushan-Vishnuroopam\' showing the different forms of Vishnu with a small, superimposed painting of the group by Roger Law) (from a photo portrait by Karl Ferris) blended in.\n\nIn November a giant B&W blow up of the fantastic day-glo pink, orange & blue offset litho print over gold foil, Haphash/Osiris poster featuring Hendrix dressed as a Native American, wearing a feathered War Bonnet, was used as a background to his appearance on \'Hoepla\', a controversial Dutch TV show. This poster, although produced later in London, and supposedly commissioned by Hendrix has text along the top to make it appear as if it was an original poster, advertising his (post Monterey) 1967 Fillmore concerts, this design was possibly what he had in mind. Original prints of this poster are probably all in collections and only later copies occasionally come up for sale at huge prices.\n\nThe original Track UK issue came in a gatefold sleeve with a large B&W portrait photo of the group by Donald Silverstein spread over the inside and an orange sheet insert with overprinted lyrics in red, the allegedly high cost of this packaging was a topic of note in the music press. The USA issue had no insert and instead of the group photo inside, had the lyrics. In Europe, the Polydor issue had no lyrics and unfortunately stuck an inch wide white border round the inside portrait, spoiling its effect, while the French dispensed with the original cover entirely and put it in a dull single sleeve with a photo of the group taken from a recent French TV show on the front.\n\n""Little Wing"" has become one of Hendrix\'s best-known songs. It was covered three years after its initial release by Eric Clapton\'s short lived band, Derek and the Dominos. The song was also popularized as an instrumental rock song by Stevie Ray Vaughan. Kirk Hammett of Metallica covered the song on live performances, Skid Row (not the original group of that name) released a live version of it on their EP B-Side Ourselves, and Sting included an adult contemporary rendition of the song on his ...Nothing Like the Sun album. Irish band The Corrs also recorded a cover of the song on their album Talk On Corners and on their Unplugged album. It was also covered by young American singer/songwriter John Mayer. It also appeared on the album G3 Live: Rockin\' in the Free World, namely by Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\nAnother notable musician who has covered a song from Axis: Bold as Love is Brian May who covered ""One Rainy Wish"" on his Another World album. John Mayer covered ""Wait Until Tomorrow"" on Try! and ""Bold as Love"" on Continuum. New York Rock & Roll Ensemble also covered ""Wait Until Tomorrow."" Joan Osborne, of ""What If God Was One of Us"" fame also covered ""Bold as Love"" on How Sweet It Is. The Pretenders also covered ""Bold as Love"" on the 1993 Hendrix tribute album Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded covers of ""Little Miss Lover"" and ""Castles Made of Sand"" for possible inclusion on their album \'Blood Sugar Sex Magik\'. They were later released as bonus tracks on the iTunes re-release of the album. They also released a live cover of ""Castles Made of Sand"" on \'Out in LA\' and later the re-release of their album Mother\'s Milk.\n\nPhish has also covered some of Jimi\'s songs, including ""Bold as Love"", on live CDs and concerts.\n\nCaetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil covered ""Wait Until Tomorrow"" on their album Tropicalia 25.\n\n""Spanish Castle Magic"" has also been covered by Carlos Santana and appears on the album ""Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"".\n\nPM Dawn covered ""You Got Me Floatin\'"", also on the 1993 Hendrix tribute album Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/Axis:+Bold+As+Love"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Having seen the group live, Galluci said to Holzman that it was an ""Interesting group, but I don\'t think you can get this feeling on tape"". Holzman said it didn\'t matter anyway because he had already reserved recording time in L.A. The album was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California from 11 May to 25 May 1970.Galluci\'s plan as a producer was to record a about a dozen takes of each song every day and pick which one that would appear on the album. The first day consisted of sound checking and run-throughs of the songs prepared. The entire band used headphones with the bass and drums isolated by baffles while Iggy Pop sang his vocals through a condensor microphone on a boom.The result was terrible in the band\'s opinion. They took exception to the atmosphere inside the studio with sound proof paddings and isolators. To achieve the vision that The Stooges and Galluci had, they stripped the entire studio of its attire to take the next step into a pseudo-live feel. According to Galluci, they set up the band in the way they normally play at a concert. For example, Iggy was singing through a hand-held microphone, and the guitar and bass amps were placed side by side. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges/Fun+House"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Records. While R.E.M. had intended to make a harder-rocking album after dealing primarily with acoustic based sounds on its previous record Out of Time (1991), the group eventually abandoned that goal and created an album that was musically subdued and dealt with mortality. Automatic for the People reached number two on the US album charts and yielded six singles. It was ranked #247 in Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAfter promotional duties for their previous album Out of Time in May 1991, the members of R.E.M. began work on their next album. Starting the first week of June, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry met several times a week in a rehearsal studio to work on new material. Once a month they would take a week-long break. The musicians would often trade instruments: Buck would play mandolin, Mills would play piano or organ, and Berry would play bass. Buck explained that writing without drums was productive for the band members. The band, intent on delivering an album of harder-rocking material after Out of Time, made an effort to write some faster rock songs during rehearsals, but came up with less than a half dozen prospective songs in that vein.\n\nWhen it came time to make demos, the musicians recorded them in their standard band configuration. According to Buck, the musicians recorded about 30 songs. Singer Michael Stipe was not present at these sessions; instead, the band gave him the finished demos at the start of 1992. Stipe described the music to Rolling Stone early that year as “very mid-tempo, pretty fucking weird More acoustic, more organ-based, less drums”. In February, R.E.M. recorded another set of demos at Daniel Lanois’ Kingsway Studios in New Orleans.\n\nThe group decided to create finished recordings with co-producer Scott Litt at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, starting on March 30. The band recorded overdubs in Miami and New York City. String arrangements were recorded in Atlanta, Georgia. After recording sessions were completed in July, the album was mixed at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle.\n\nAutomatic for the People was released in October 1992. In the United States, the album reached number two on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album reached number one in the United Kingdom, where it topped the UK Albums Chart on four separate occasions. Despite not having toured after the release of Out of Time, R.E.M. again declined to tour in support of this album. Automatic for the People has been certified four times platinum in the United States (four million copies shipped), six times platinum in the United Kingdom (1.8 million shipped), and three times platinum in Australia (210,000 shipped). The album has sold 3.5 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nAutomatic for the People yielded six singles over the course of 1992 and 1993: “Drive”, “Man on the Moon”, “The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite”, “Everybody Hurts”, “Nightswimming”, and “Find the River”. Lead single “Drive” was the album’s highest-charting domestic hit, reaching number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other singles charted higher overseas: “Everybody Hurts” charted in the top ten in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\n\nR.E.M. biographer David Buckley wrote, “Automatic for the People is regarded by Peter Buck and Mike Mills, and by most critics, as being the finest R.E.M. album ever recorded.” Rolling Stone gave the album five stars. Reviewer Paul Evans wrote, “Despite its difficult concerns, most of Automatic is musically irresistible.” Melody Maker reviewer Allan Jones commented, “It’s almost impossible to write about the record without mentioning the recent grim rumors concerning Stipe’s health”, in reference to the rumors at the time that the singer was dying of AIDS or cancer. Jones concluded his review by noting, “Amazingly, initial reactions to Automatic for the People in this particular vicinity have been mixed Psshaw to them. Automatic for the People is R.E.M. at the very top of their form.” Ann Powers, reviewing the album for The New York Times, noted that only three of the songs on the album went beyond mid-tempo and said, “Only ‘Man on the Moon’ shines with a wit that balances R.E.M.’s somber tendencies”. Powers finished her review by saying, “Even in the midst of such disenchantment, R.E.M. can’t resist its own talent for creating beautiful and moving sounds. Buck, Mills and Berry can still conjure melodies that fall like summer sunlight. And Stipe still possesses a gorgeous voice that cannot shake its own gift for meaning.”Guy Garcia, for Time, also noted the album’s themes of “hopelessness, anger and loss”. Garcia added that the album proves “that a so-called alternative band can keep its edge after conquering the musical mainstream” and that it “manages to dodge predictability without ever sounding aimless or unfocussed”. Automatic for the People placed third in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics’ poll. The album was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1993. It was also ranked #247 in Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nIn 2005, Warner Bros. Records issued a two-disc edition of Automatic for the People which includes a CD, a DVD-Audio disc containing a 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner, and the original CD booklet with expanded liner notes.\n\nThe album name refers to the motto of Athens, Georgia, eatery Weaver D’s Delicious Fine Foods. The photograph on the front cover is not related to the restaurant: it shows a star ornament that was part of the sign for the Sinbad Motel on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, near Criteria Studios, where the bulk of the album was recorded. The motel is still there, but the star is not. The slanted support where it was once attached is still there on the roof of the Sinbad. The interior jacket shows a two–three story circular platform that was the sign for the old Bon Aire Motel on the former Motel Row on Miami Beach. The Bon Aire and other motel row establishments have mostly been demolished for new high-rise condominiums.\n\nThe front cover of the album shows a greyed-out photograph of a Miami motel sign placed over an embossed image, which is also included inside the album’s booklet distorted on a white background. The back cover features a photograph of an old building with the track listing written over at the same angle from which the building is viewed. Other photographs, taken by Anton Corbijn, feature the band members on a beach. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Automatic+for+the+People"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With the band\'s rising popularity from the release of Metallica, awareness of the album has increased, and according to the RIAA, it has sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone. It was the last album the band recorded with bass player Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus crash six months after it was released.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nThe band\'s line-up during the album\'s recording was James Hetfield on vocals and rhythm guitar, Lars Ulrich on drums, Kirk Hammett on lead guitar, and Cliff Burton on bass. The album is remembered in part due to the death of Burton shortly after the release of the album in a bus accident while supporting the album on tour.\n\nWhen it was released, Master of Puppets provided many metal fans with an alternative image to the commercially popular glam metal bands, such as Poison, Bon Jovi,Mötley Crüe, and Ratt. The album has frequently been tagged by critics as ""one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time.""\n\nAs an early parody of the PMRC\'s ""explicit lyrics"" warning labels, many prints of Metallica\'s 1986 release of Master of Puppets sported a sticker on the front in the shape of a stop-sign saying:\n\n    ""The only track you probably won\'t want to play is ""Damage, Inc."" due to the multiple use of the infamous ""F"" word. otherwise, there aren\'t any ""Shits,"" ""Fucks,"" ""Pisses,"" ""Sucks,"" ""Cunts,"" ""Motherfuckers,"" or ""Cocksuckers"" anywhere on this record""\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release, Metallica played the album in its entirety on their Escape from the Studio \'06 tour, for the first time ever at the Rock am Ring festival on June 3, 2006. These concerts included the first-ever complete performances of the instrumental ""Orion"" (though portions of the song\'s lengthy middle section had been performed at various times as part of instrumental medleys and bass solos since the early 1990s).\n\nThe title track was ranked Number 51 in the ""The Greatest Guitar Solos"" from Guitar World. In 2006, the album was voted the fourth ""greatest guitar album of all time"" in Guitar World. And the April 5, edition of Kerrang! was dedicated to it, providing readers with the cover album ""Master of Puppets: Remastered"". In March 2007, the guitar magazine Total Guitar ranked the 100 greatest riffs of all time, and the main riff in the album\'s title track was ranked number one.\n\nFormer Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine has long claimed to have written the riff for ""Leper Messiah"". Metallica has denied it.\n\nIn 1999, Master of Puppets was re-released with Ride the Lightning in a remastered audiophile Gold CD edition mixed by renowned engineer Steve Hoffman.\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, Master of Puppets was immediately commercially successful, selling over half a million copies at its time of release without any major video/radio airplay, making it the band\'s first record to be certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\nAccording to Allmusic\'s Steve Huey, Master of Puppets ""was the band\'s greatest achievement."" ""Some critics have called Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album ever recorded"", Huey noted. Master of Puppets has featured on several ""greatest albums of all time"" lists. The album is present in a list dubbed ""The All-TIME 100 Albums"" and published by TIME magazine in November 2006. In TIME critic Josh Tyrangiel\'s opinion, ""Metallica didn\'t bother with hooks or pop discipline"" in writing Master of Puppets. Metal Rules rated the album as being number one in a list of the ""Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums"" published in September 2003, whereas IGN also rated the album as being at first position in a list of the ""Top 25 Metal Albums"" issued in January 2007. It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and Q magazine counted it among the 50 heaviest albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 167 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Master+of+Puppets"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Even though she usually doesn\'t discuss who her songs are about, Swift told Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard that she would agree to disclose the inspiration for ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" for a six figure donation to charity. Following in the footsteps of one of her idol\'s, whom she mimics quite often, Carly Simon.\n\nThe second single, ""Begin Again"" was released in October 1. Red has also spawned three other promotional singles, all of them reached top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Red has been mostly acclaimed by music critics, who praised Swift\'s versatility as a musician and enjoyed her experiments with new music genres. Red sold 1,208,000 copies in its first week in the U.S, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and scored the highest number one debut in the US for the 2010s decade so far. Red is also Swift\'s first chart-topper in the U.K., and also topped the album charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/Red"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London and released on Atlantic Records on 12 January 1969. The album featured integral contributions from each of the group\'s four musicians and established Led Zeppelin\'s fusion of blues and rock. Led Zeppelin also created a large and devoted following for the band, with their unique heavy metal sound endearing them to a section of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAlthough the album initially received negative reviews, it was commercially very successful and has now come to be regarded in a much more positive light by critics. In 2003, the album was ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn August 1968, the English rock band The Yardbirds had completely disbanded. Guitarist Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds\' sole remaining member, was left with rights to the group’s name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in Scandinavia. For his new band, Page recruited bassist John Paul Jones, vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham. During September 1968, the group toured Scandinavia as The New Yardbirds, performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as ""Communication Breakdown"", ""I Can\'t Quit You Baby"", ""You Shook Me"", ""Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You"" and ""How Many More Times"". The month after they returned to England, October 1968, Page changed the band\'s name to Led Zeppelin, and the group entered Olympic Studios in London to record their debut album.\n\nIn a 1990 interview, Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knows this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin\'s tour of Scandinavia in September 1968.  As Page explained, ""the band had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly.""\n\nIn addition, since the band had not yet signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Led Zeppelin\'s manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom, ""I wanted artistic control in a vice grip, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic. ... It wasn\'t your typical story where you get an advance to make an album—we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic\'s reaction was very positive—I mean they signed us, didn\'t they?""\n\nThe group recorded their songs reportedly for £1,782. Led Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis noted that ""with the possible exception of the 12 hours that the Beatles took to record their first album at Abbey Road, rarely has studio time been used so economically. Led Zeppelin\'s debut album went on to gross more than £3.5 million, just short of 2,000 times more than they invested!""\n\nFor the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted Fender Telecaster, a gift from Jeff Beck after Page recommended his boyhood friend to the Yardbirds in 1965 as potential replacement for Eric Clapton on lead guitar. This was a different guitar from those he favoured for later albums (most notably a Gibson Les Paul). Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier. He also used a Gibson J-200, borrowed from Big Jim Sullivan, for the album\'s acoustic tracks.\n\nLed Zeppelin was produced by Jimmy Page and engineered by Glyn Johns, who had previously worked with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who. According to Page, ""The first album is a live album, it really is, and it\'s done intentionally in that way. It\'s got overdubs on it, but the original tracks are live.""\n\nPage reportedly used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this ""distance equals depth"" technique, Page became one of the first producers to record a band\'s ""ambient sound""—the distance of a note\'s time-lag from one end of the room to the other.\n\nAnother notable feature of the album was the ""leakage"" on the recordings of Robert Plant\'s vocals. In a 1998 Guitar World interview, Page stated that ""Robert\'s voice was extremely powerful and, as a result, would get on some of the other tracks. But oddly, the leakage sounds intentional.""On the track ""You Shook Me"", Page used the ""backward echo"" technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nThe album was one of the first albums to be released in stereo-only form; at the time the practice of releasing both mono and stereo versions was the norm.\n\nLed Zeppelin\'s front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning Hindenburg airship. The image refers to the origin of the band\'s name itself: when Page, Jeff Beck and The Who\'s Keith Moon and John Entwistle were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, ""It would probably go over like a lead balloon"", and Entwistle allegedly replied, ""...a Lead Zeppelin!""\n\nThe album\'s back cover features a photograph of the band taken by former-Yardbird Chris Dreja. The entire design of the album\'s sleeve was coordinated by George Hardie, with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.\n\nHardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco—a multi-sequential image of a phallic zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin\'s first two albums and a number of early press advertisements. During the first few weeks of release in the UK, the sleeve featured the band\'s name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When this was switched to the now-common orange print later in the year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector\'s item.\n\nThe album cover received widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as ""The Nobs"" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the Hindenburg crashing in flames, threatened to have the show pulled off the air. In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone that ""The cover of Led Zeppelin. . . shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames. The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up.""\n\nThe conceptual originality of the album was displayed on tracks such as ""Good Times Bad Times"", ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Communication Breakdown"", which had a distinctively heavy sound to the ears of young rock fans in the late-1960s. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate steel-string acoustic guitar by Page on ""Black Mountain Side"", and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on their adaptation of ""Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You"".\n\n""Dazed and Confused"" is arguably the album\'s centerpiece: a foreboding arrangement featuring a descending bass line from Jones, heavy drumming from Bonham and some powerful guitar riffs and soloing from Page. It also showcased Page playing guitar with a violin bow (an idea suggested by David McCallum Sr., whom Page had met while doing studio session work). The bowed guitar in the middle section of the song brought psychedelic rock to experimental new heights, especially in extended stage versions, building on Page\'s earlier renderings of the song during the latter days of The Yardbirds. ""Dazed and Confused"" would become Led Zeppelin\'s signature performance piece for years to come. The bowed guitar technique is also used on ""How Many More Times"", a song which features a ""Bolero"" riff and an improvised shift in cadence.\n\nMany of Led Zeppelin\'s earliest songs were based on blues standards, and the album also included three songs composed by others: ""You Shook Me"" and ""I Can\'t Quit You Baby"", both by blues artist Willie Dixon; and ""Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You"". Regarding the last of these, at the time guitarist Jimmy Page mistakenly believed he was adapting a traditional folk song he had heard on a Joan Baez record, but this was corrected on subsequent rereleases after it was revealed that the song was composed by Anne Bredon in the 1950s. Dixon, on the other hand, received proper credit as the composer of his two songs on this album (although ""You Shook Me"" would later be additionally credited to J. B. Lenoir) but would go on to settle out of court with Led Zeppelin over partial use of other material of his on Plant\'s lyrics to ""Whole Lotta Love"". On ""You Shook Me"", Plant vocally mimics Page\'s guitar effects—a metallicised version of the ""call and response"" blues technique.\n\nJeff Beck had previously recorded ""You Shook Me"" for his album, Truth, and accused Page of stealing his idea. With John Paul Jones and drummer Keith Moon of The Who, Page had played on (and says he arranged) ""Beck\'s Bolero"", an instrumental on Truth that would be grooved into the mix of the Led Zeppelin jam ""How Many More Times"". These cross-pollinations led to a rift between Beck and Page, who had played in the Yardbirds together and been friends since childhood. In fact, it was Page who first suggested Beck for the Yardbirds\' guitarist position when he was contacted by the band after Eric Clapton\'s departure.\n\nIn an interview he gave in 1975, Page offered his own perspective on the album\'s music:\n\n    For material, we obviously went right down to our blues roots. I still had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over. By the time Jeff Beck did go, it was up to me to come up with a lot of new stuff. It was this thing where Eric Clapton set a heavy precedent in the Yardbirds which Beck had to follow and then it was even harder for me, in a way, because the second lead guitarist had suddenly become the first. And I was under pressure to come up with my own riffs. On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the earlier days. I think it tells a bit, too... It was obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we\'d have all sat around jamming for six months. But after that, on the second LP, you can really hear the group identity coming together.\n\nPlant is credited on the album with ""occasional bass"". In an interview he gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 2005, Plant made reference to this:\n\n    In truth, I was an occasional bass player. It says so on Zeppelin I, next to my name: vocals, harmonica and occasional bass. Very occasionally -- once, I think, since 1968. How in God\'s name that ended up on the cover is so funny. I\'m sure Jonesy John Paul Jones didn\'t like it *laughs*. But I suppose every time he fucked up he could say it was me.\n\nThe album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan ""Led Zeppelin — the only way to fly"".  It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, Rolling Stone magazine asserted that the band offered ""little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn\'t say as well or better three months ago ... It would seem that if they are to fil the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to find a producer, editor and some material worthy of their collective talents.""  It also called Plant ""as foppish as Rod Stewart, but nowhere near so exciting"". John Paul Jones later recalled:\n\n    We had appalling press at the time. Nobody seemed to want to know us for one reason or another. We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was going on about us as another hyped British band. We couldn\'t belive it. In our naivety we thought we\'d done a good album and were doing all right, and then this venom comes flying out. We couldn\'t understand why or what we\'d done to them. After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation. We avodied them and so they avoided us. It was only because we did a lot of show that our reputation got around as a good live band.\n\nAs was noted by rock journalist Cameron Crowe years later: ""It was a time of ""super-groups,"" of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity.""\n\nHowever, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in the Melody Maker. Chris Welch wrote, in a review titled ""Jimmy Page triumphs — Led Zeppelin is a gas!"": ""their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands"".\n\nThe album was very commercially successful. It was initially released in America on 17 January 1969 to capitalise on the band\'s first U.S. concert tour. Before that, Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled with a good reaction to the band\'s opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders. Within two months of its release the album had reached Billboard\'s Top 10. It stayed on the Billboard chart for 73 weeks and held a 79-week run on the British charts. By 1975 it had grossed $7,000,000.\n\nThe success and influence of the album is today widely acknowledged, even amongst those critics who were initially skeptical. In 2006, for example, Rolling Stone stated that\n\n    The album was pretty much unlike anything else. The arrangements were more sculpted than those of Cream or Jimi Hendrix, and the musicianship wasn\'t cumbersome like Iron Butterfly\'s or bombastic like Vanilla Fudge\'s. The closest comparisons might be to MC5 or the Stooges—both from Michigan—yet neither had the polish or prowess of Led Zeppelin, nor did Led Zeppelin have the political, social or die-hard sensibility of those landmark bands. What they did have, though, was the potential for a mass audience.\n\nAccording to Lewis:\n\n    Time has done nothing to diminish the quality of one of the finest debut albums ever recorded. There\'s an urgency and enthusiasm about their performance that retains timeless charm. The nine cuts offer a tour de force of powerful yet often subtle dynamics ... And let\'s not forget the fact that with this album, Page virtually invents the guitar riff as a key songwriting component.\n\nIn 2003, VH1 named Led Zeppelin the 44th greatest album of all time, while Rolling Stone ranked it 29th on the magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is widely regarded as marking a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nPublication   Country    Accolade     Year      Rank\n\nThe Times United Kingdom ""The 100 Best Albums of All Time"" 1993 41\nRolling Stone United States The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 2003 29\nGrammy Awards \tUnited States Grammy Hall of Fame Award 2004\t*\nQ United Kingdom ""The Music That Changed the World"" 2004 7\nRobert Dimery United States 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die 2006 *\nClassic Rock United Kingdom\t""100 Greatest British Rock Album Ever""\t2006 81\nUncut United Kingdom 100 Greatest Debut Albums 2006 7\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame United States The Definitive 200 2007 165\nQ United Kingdom 21 Albums That Changed Music 2007 6\n\n\n""How Many More Times"" was listed as 3:30 on the record sleeve deliberately by Jimmy Page in order to trick radio stations into playing the song.citation needed\n\nRobert Plant participated in songwriting but wasn\'t given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with CBS Records.\n\nSome cassette versions of the album reversed the order of the sides.

The band\'s first single, ""White Riot"", was released in March; the album, The Clash, came out the following month. Filled with fiery punk tracks, it also presaged the many eclectic turns the band would take with its cover of the reggae song ""Police and Thieves"". Though both the single and album charted well in the UK—""White Riot"" reached number 34, The Clash number 12—CBS refused to release either in the United States, saying that the sound was not “radio friendly”.A US version of the album (this version) with a modified track listing was released in 1979, after the UK original became the best-selling import album of all time in the United States.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/The+Clash"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the band\'s first album of the 1970s and its first release on the band\'s newly formed label, Rolling Stones Records, after having been contracted since 1963 with Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the US. It is also Mick Taylor\'s first full-length appearance on a Rolling Stones album, the first Rolling Stones album not to feature any contributions from guitarist and founder Brian Jones and the first one on which singer Mick Jagger is credited with playing guitar.\nSticky Fingers is widely regarded as one of the Rolling Stones\' best albums. It achieved triple platinum certification in the US and contains songs such as the chart-topping ""Brown Sugar"", the country ballad ""Wild Horses"", the Latin-inspired ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"", and the sweeping ballad ""Moonlight Mile"".\nWith the end of their Decca/London association at hand, The Rolling Stones would finally be free to release their albums (cover art and all) as they pleased. However, their departing manager Allen Klein dealt the group a major blow when they discovered that they had inadvertently signed over their entire 1960s copyrights to Klein and his company ABKCO, which is how all of their material from 1963\'s ""Come On"" to Get Yer Ya-Ya\'s Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert has since come to be released by ABKCO Records. The band would remain incensed with Klein for decades over the act.\nWhen Decca informed The Rolling Stones that they were owed one more single, they cheekily submitted a track called ""Cocksucker Blues"", which was guaranteed to be refused. Instead, Decca released the two-year-old Beggars Banquet track ""Street Fighting Man"" while Klein would have dual copyright ownership, with The Rolling Stones, of ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Wild Horses"".\n\n\nRecording\nAlthough sessions for Sticky Fingers began in earnest in March 1970, The Rolling Stones had recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama in December 1969 and ""Sister Morphine"", cut during Let It Bleed\'s sessions earlier in March of that year, was held over for this release. Much of the recording for Sticky Fingers was made with The Rolling Stones\' mobile studio unit in Stargroves during the summer and autumn of 1970. Early versions of songs that would appear on Exile on Main St. were also rehearsed during these sessions\n\nArtwork\n\nStandard version:\nThe Rolling Stones posing in an ad with the artwork from Sticky Fingers in 1971, from left to right: Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger\nThe album\'s artwork emphasises the suggestive innuendo of the Sticky Fingers title, showing a close-up of a jeans-clad male crotch with the visible outline of a large penis; the cover of the original (vinyl) release featured a working zipper and mock belt buckle that opened to reveal cotton briefs. The vinyl release displayed the band\'s name and album title along the image of the belt; behind the zipper the white briefs were seemingly rubber stamped in gold with the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol, below which read ""THIS PHOTOGRAPH MAY NOT BE—ETC."" While the artwork was conceived by Warhol, photography was by Billy Name and design by Craig Braun.\n\nThe cover photo of a male model\'s crotch clad in tight blue jeans was assumed by many fans to be an image of Mick Jagger, but the people actually involved at the time of the photo shoot claim that Warhol had several different men photographed (Jagger was not among them) and never revealed which shots he used. Among the candidates, Jed Johnson, Warhol\'s lover at the time, denied it was his likeness, although his twin brother Jay is a possibility. Those closest to the shoot, and subsequent design, name Factory artist and designer Corey Tippin as the likeliest candidate. Warhol ""superstar"" Joe Dallesandro claims to have been the model.\nAfter retailers complained that the zipper was causing damage to the vinyl (from stacked shipments of the record), the zipper was ""unzipped"" slightly to the middle of the record, where damage would be minimised.\nThe album features the first usage of the band\'s ""tongue & lips"" logo, which was originally designed by Ernie Cefalu. Although Ernie\'s version was used for much of the merchandising and was the design originally shown to the band by Craig Braun, the design used for the album was illustrated by John Pasche.\nIn 2003, the TV network VH1 named Sticky Fingers the ""No. 1 Greatest Album Cover"" of all time.\n\nAlternative version and covers\nIn Spain, the original cover was censored and replaced with a ""Can of fingers"" cover, and ""Sister Morphine"" was replaced by a live version of Chuck Berry\'s ""Let It Rock"". This version was released on the compilation album Rarities 1971–2003 in 2005.\nIn 1992, the LP release of the album in Russia featured a similar treatment as the original cover; but with Cyrillic lettering for the band name and album name, a colourised photograph of blue jeans with a zipper, and a Soviet Army uniform belt buckle that shows a hammer and sickle inscribed in a star. The model appears to be female.\n\n\nRelease and reception:\nSticky Fingers hit the number one spot on the British charts in May 1971, remaining there for four weeks before returning at number one for a further week in mid June. In the US, the album hit number one within days of release, and stayed there for four weeks. In Germany it was one of only two non-German albums to reach number one in 1971.\nIn a contemporary review for the Los Angeles Times, music critic Robert Hilburn said that although Sticky Fingers is one of the best rock albums of the year, it is only ""modest"" by the Rolling Stones\' standards and succeeds on the strength of songs such as ""Bitch"" and ""Dead Flowers"", which recall the band\'s previously uninhibited, furious style. Jon Landau, writing in Rolling Stone, felt that it lacks the spirit and spontaneity of the Rolling Stones\' previous two albums and, apart from ""Moonlight Mile"", is full of ""forced attempts at style and control"" in which the band sounds disinterested, particularly on formally correct songs such as ""Brown Sugar"". In a positive review, Lynn Van Matre of the Chicago Tribune viewed the album as the band ""at their raunchy best"" and wrote that, although it is ""hardly innovative"", it is consistent enough to be one of the year\'s best albums.\nSticky Fingers was voted the second best album of the year in The Village Voice\u200a\'\u200bs annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1971. Lester Bangs voted it number one in the poll and said that it was his most played album of the year. Robert Christgau, the poll\'s creator, ranked the album seventeenth on his own year-end list. In a 1975 article for The Village Voice, Christgau suggested that the release was ""triffling with decadence"", but might be the Rolling Stones\' best album, approached only by Exile on Main St. (1972). In his 1980 review of the album, he wrote that it reflected how unapologetic the band was after the Altamont Free Concert and that, despite the concession to sincerity with ""Wild Horses"", songs such as ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"" and ""I Got the Blues"" are as ""soulful"" as ""Good Times"", and their cover of ""You Gotta Move"" is on-par with their previous covers of ""Prodigal Son"" and ""Love in Vain"".\nIn 1994, Sticky Fingers was ranked number ten in Colin Larkin\'s All Time Top 1000 Albums. He stated, ""Dirty rock like this has still to be bettered, and there is still no rival in sight."" In a retrospective review, Q magazine said that the album was ""the Stones at their assured, showboating peak ... A magic formula of heavy soul, junkie blues and macho rock"". NME wrote that it ""captures the Stones bluesy swagger"" in a ""dark-land where few dare to tread"". Record Collector magazine said that it showcases Jagger and Richards as they ""delve even further back to the primitive blues that first inspired them and step up their investigations into another great American form, country."" In his review for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that the album still is superior to ""most of The Rolling Stones’ catalog"".In 2003, Sticky Fingers was listed as No. 63 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nIn 1994, Sticky Fingers was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records. It was remastered again in 2009 by Universal Music Enterprises and in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version.\nOn 31 March 2015, The Rolling Stones announced that Sticky Fingers will be reissued (this time in relation to a new concert tour, the Zip Code Tour). These Deluxe and Super Deluxe reissues will be released on 8/9 June 2015 in a variety of formats and will feature a variety of extensive (previously unreleased) rare bonus material (depending on the format): alternative re-workings of some tracks, live tracks from the two Rolling Stones shows on 14 March 1971 at the Roundhouse, London and live tracks from the Rolling Stones show on 13 March 1971 at the Leeds University-\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\nAll songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one:\t\nNo.  Title\tLength\t\n1.\t""Brown Sugar""  \t3:48\n2.\t""Sway""  \t3:50    (Jagger/Taylor)\n3.\t""Wild Horses""  \t5:42\n4.\t""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking""  \t7:14\n5.\t""You Gotta Move"" (Fred McDowell/Gary Davis)\t2:32\nSide two:\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n6.\t""Bitch""  \t3:38\n7.\t""I Got the Blues""  \t3:54\n8.\t""Sister Morphine"" (Jagger/Richards/Marianne Faithfull)\t5:31\n9.\t""Dead Flowers""  \t4:03\n10.\t""Moonlight Mile""  \n\n\nPersonnel:\nThe Rolling Stones\nMick Jagger – lead vocals; acoustic guitar on ""Dead Flowers"" and ""Moonlight Mile""; rhythm guitar on ""Sway""; percussion on ""Brown Sugar""\nKeith Richards – rhythm guitar; acoustic guitar on ""Brown Sugar"", ""You Gotta Move"", ""I Got the Blues"" and ""Sister Morphine""; twelve string acoustic guitar on ""Wild Horses""; lead guitar on ""Wild Horses"", the first part of ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"" and ""Bitch""; co-lead guitar on ""Dead Flowers"", backing vocals\nMick Taylor – lead guitar; acoustic guitar on ""Wild Horses""; rhythm guitar on the first part of ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"" and ""Bitch""; slide guitar on ""Sway"" and ""You Gotta Move""; lead guitar on ""Dead Flowers"" ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"" ""Moonlight Mile"" ""Sway"" (not present during ""Sister Morphine"" sessions)\nBill Wyman – bass guitar; electric piano on ""You Gotta Move""\nCharlie Watts – drums\nAdditional personnel:\nPaul Buckmaster – string arrangement on ""Sway"" and ""Moonlight Mile""\nRy Cooder – slide guitar on ""Sister Morphine""\nJim Dickinson – piano on ""Wild Horses""\nRocky Dijon – congas on ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking""\nNicky Hopkins – piano on ""Sway"", ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking""\nBobby Keys – saxophone\nJimmy Miller – percussion on ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking""\nJack Nitzsche – piano on ""Sister Morphine""\nBilly Preston – organ on ""Can\'t You Hear Me Knocking"" and ""I Got the Blues""\nJim Price – trumpet, piano on ""Moonlight Mile""\nIan Stewart – piano on ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Dead Flowers""\nEngineers – Glyn Johns, Andy Johns, Chris Kimsey, Jimmy Johnson\nCover concept/photography – Andy Warhol <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Sticky+Fingers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Producer Tom Dowd skillfully trimmed some of the performances down to relatively concise running time (edits later restored on the double-disc set The Fillmore Concerts), at times condensing several performances into one track. Far from being a sacrilege, this tactic helps present the Allmans in their best light, since even if the music isn\'t necessarily concise (three tracks run over ten minutes, with two in the 20-minute range), it does showcase the group\'s terrific instrumental interplay, letting each member (but particularly guitarist Duane and keyboardist/vocalist Gregg) shine. Even after the release of the unedited concerts, this original double album (single CD) remains the pinnacle of the Allmans and Southern rock at its most elastic, bluesy, and jazzy.  \n\nA good idea that worked out even better, with one small caveat. The Fillmore Concerts is made up of performances from the two Fillmore shows that originally comprised Live at the Fillmore East and the concert portions of Eat a Peach, plus one track (""One Way Out"") from a Fillmore show from a couple of months later. The 16-track masters from each show are transferred to digital and remixed by original producer Tom Dowd. The sound is sterling and the two-hour-plus running time makes this a dream for fans of the band, as well as an improvement on the original releases of this material. It is also a slightly less honest release, where ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" is concerned — Dowd edited the version here together from two different performances, first and second shows, the dividing line being where Duane Allman\'s solo comes in. Not that this is the only concert album where this kind of editing has been done, but the original Live at the Fillmore contained a single take of the song, and some purists may prefer that. Otherwise, this set runs circles around more than 99 percent of the guitar albums ever released, with breathtaking sound (which, unlike the similarly conceived but less effective Derek & the Dominos Live at the Fillmore, loses none of its bite), and most fans might as well start here. \n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Allman+Brothers+Band/At+Fillmore+East"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie and mixed by Scott Litt and J Mascis. The lyrics and packaging reflect Love\'s thematic preoccupations with beauty, and motifs of milk, motherhood, anti-elitism, and violence against women, while Love derived the album title from a quote in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nAt the time of its release, the album was met with critical acclaim, and it earned top-100 chart spots in seven countries before going multi-platinum in December 1994. Despite this, it was also the subject of some public discussion regarding unsubstantiated rumors  that Love\'s husband, Kurt Cobain —who died by suicide one week before the album\'s release — helped ghostwrite the album. This claim has been disputed by the band members, producers, as well as music biographers, though the band confirmed that Cobain sang additional backing vocals on two tracks during a visit to the studio.\n\nIn critical circles, Live Through This is considered a contemporary classic, and was included in Rolling Stone\'s 2020 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 460, as well as being featured on the list 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album was also named the 84th greatest album of all time in a list produced by NME in 2013. As of 2010, it has sold over 1.6 million copies in the United States. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Hole/Live+Through+This"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Reed lauded Ronson\'s contribution in the Transformer episode of the documentary series Classic Albums, praising the beauty of his work and fading out the vocal to highlight the strings. The songs on the LP are now among Reed\'s best-known works, including ""Walk on the Wild Side"", ""Perfect Day"" and ""Satellite of Love"", and the album\'s commercial success elevated him from cult status to become an international star in his own right.\n\n""Andy\'s Chest"" had been recorded in 1969 for The Velvet Underground\'s ""lost fourth album"" (see VU and Another View) and ""Satellite of Love"" had been demoed for the band\'s 1970 album Loaded, but neither had been used. For Transformer, the poppy up-tempo feel of these songs was slowed down to turn them into ballads. Although all songs on the album were credited to Reed, it has long been rumoured that ""Wagon Wheel"" is actually a David Bowie composition. Although there are no known performances of ""Vicious"" by the Velvet Underground, the song apparently dates from Reed\'s time in the band and its association with Andy Warhol. According to Reed, Warhol told Reed he should write a song about someone vicious. Reed inquired what he meant by that, and Warhol replied, ""Oh, you know, vicious like I hit you with a flower.""\n\nThe first single from the album, ""Walk on the Wild Side"", became an international success, despite its adult subject matter (it was edited in some countries and banned in others) and it is now generally regarded as Reed\'s signature tune. ""Satellite of Love"" was issued as the second single in February 1973. In 2002, a 30th anniversary edition of the album was released; in addition to demos of ""Hangin\' Round"" and ""Perfect Day"", it includes a hidden track featuring an advert for the album.\n\nThe cover art was from a Mick Rock photograph.\n\nIn 1997, Transformer was named the 44th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. Transformer is also ranked number 55 on NME \'s list of ""Greatest Albums of All Time."" In 2003, the album was ranked number 194 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is also on Q Magazine\'s list of ""100 Greatest Albums Ever"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/Transformer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It enabled Jackson to transition into the popular music market, becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.\n\nContaining autobiographical themes, a majority of the album\'s lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to the singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization.\n\nControl is widely regarded as the breakthrough album of Jackson\'s career. It became her first album to top the Billboard 200 and five of its commercial singles—""What Have You Done for Me Lately"", ""Nasty"", ""Control"", ""When I Think of You"", and ""Let\'s Wait Awhile""—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV\'s evolving demographics. The album went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time. It has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than fourteen million copies worldwide.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Janet+Jackson/Control"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The amount of material was such that Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was released as a double album, his first. This album had originally been planned to be recorded in Jamaica, since The Rolling Stones had recorded Goats Head Soup there. Technical difficulties, coupled with political unrest in the country at the time, forced the band to make an early departure without any productive work done.\n\nIn addition to the three successful singles released from this album (see below), many other cuts received substantial airplay at AOR stations when the album was released, including ""Harmony""; the 11-minute epic, ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding""; and his Marilyn Monroe tribute, ""Candle in the Wind"".\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin\n\n\n Side one\n""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" – 11:09 \n""Candle in the Wind"" – 3:49 \n""Bennie and the Jets"" – 5:23 \n\n Side two\n""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" – 3:13 \n""This Song Has No Title"" – 2:23 \n""Grey Seal"" – 4:00 \n""Jamaica Jerk-Off"" – 3:38 \n""I\'ve Seen That Movie Too"" – 5:58 \n\n Side three\n""Sweet Painted Lady"" – 3:54 \n""The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)"" – 4:23 \n""Dirty Little Girl"" – 5:01 \n""All the Girls Love Alice"" – 5:09 \n\n Side four\n""Your Sister Can\'t Twist (But She Can Rock \'n Roll)"" – 2:42 \n""Saturday Night\'s Alright for Fighting"" – 4:53 \n""Roy Rogers"" – 4:08 \n""Social Disease"" – 3:43 \n""Harmony"" – 2:46 \n\n Bonus tracks (2003 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)\n""Whenever You\'re Ready (We\'ll Go Steady Again)"" – 2:51 \n""Jack Rabbit"" – 1:49 \n""Screw You (Young Man\'s Blues)"" – 4:43 \n""Candle in the Wind""  – 3:51 \nThe original LP and CD issues were on two discs, while the 1995 CD remaster put the album on one disc as it was slightly less than 80 minutes.

The album reached number two on the UK album chart, maintaining a chart residency for 22 weeks, number 70 on the Billboard  200, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since.\n\nGuitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while The Smiths toured Britain in early 1985, working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks. After releasing their September 1985 single, ""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side"" (which is included on The Queen Is Dead in an updated, slightly re-mixed version), The Smiths turned to recording their third album. Marr produced the album with singer Morrissey, and worked with engineer Stephen Street, who had assumed the same role on the band\'s previous album, Meat Is Murder (1985). Street recalled, ""Morrissey, Johnny and I had a really good working relationship — we were all roughly the same age and into the same kind of things, so everyone felt quite relaxed in the studio"".\n\nAt the time the group was having difficulty with their label Rough Trade, which Street characterised as ""Rough Trade and EMI trying to sign up everything"". Street noted, ""But this didn\'t get in the way of recording because the atmosphere in the studio was very, very constructive."" The group recorded ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" and ""Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others"" at RAK Studios in northwest London. After a brief tour, the group recorded and mixed the majority of the album at Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey, during late 1985 and early 1986.\n\nThe album\'s title comes from the name of a chapter of Hubert Selby, Jr.\'s cult classic novel Last Exit to Brooklyn.\n\nThe Queen Is Dead finally emerged half a year later, in June 1986, and was previewed by the May single release of ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", strictly speaking the only single taken from the album. Many encouraged the band to release ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" as a single, but Johnny Marr is said to have wanted an explosive, searing single, along the lines of The Rolling Stones\' ""Jumpin\' Jack Flash"", to announce that The Smiths had returned from hiatus. It did not fare as well as expected, stalling at number 26 on the British charts.\n\nThe album is popularly regarded as The Smiths\' best album. With its unique blend of musical styles (including jangle pop, British Invasion, music hall, rockabilly and punk rock), it quickly became a British sensation and established The Smiths as one of the biggest bands of their era. Both Morrissey and Marr disagree, however, citing its 1987 successor (and unexpectedly final Smiths LP), Strangeways, Here We Come, as their peak.\n\nRolling Stone gave the album a five star rating. Reviewer Mark Coleman remarked on Morrissey\'s sense of humour and singled out the singer\'s performance on ""Cemetry Gates"" as a highlight. Coleman concluded, ""Like it or not, this guy\'s going to be around for a while."" Pitchfork Media ranked the album as the sixth best of the 1980s. In 2000, Mojo magazine placed ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" at number 25 on their list of the 100 greatest songs of all time, while VH2 placed it top of their Top 500 Indie Songs chart. In 2003, The Queen Is Dead was ranked number 216 on Rolling Stone\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2006 it was named the second greatest British album of all time by NME. In 2006, Q magazine placed the album at #3 in its list of ""40 Best Albums of the \'80s"".\n\nThe song ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", was a contender for lead single off the album, but was passed over in favour of ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"". (Later in 1986 it was released as a 7""-only single in France.) It received a belated release in 1992, when it became one of WEA\'s singles in a programme to promote Smiths re-releases (see the entry on ...Best II).\n\n\n""Cemetry Gates"" was Morrissey\'s direct response to critics who had cried foul over his use of texts written by some of his favorite authors, notably Shelagh Delaney and Elizabeth Smart. Oscar Wilde, who was also accused of plagiarism, figures as a patron saint of Morrissey\'s in the song\'s lyrics. A Wilde quote, ""Talent borrows, genius steals"", was etched in the vinyl run-out grooves of the first single off the album, ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"". ""Cemetry Gates"" also has interesting reverberations with fellow English writer Evelyn Waugh\'s 1948 novel The Loved One, much of which takes place in a cemetery. The novel\'s main character Dennis Barlow plagiarizes poems by various English poets in his overtures to Aimee Thanatogenos.\n\n""The Queen Is Dead"", which leads off the album and notably became an expressionistic music video directed by Derek Jarman, starts with a soundbite from Bryan Forbes\' 1962 British film The L-Shaped Room. Another instance of Morrissey\'s fascination with \'60s British cinema, the film featured performances by Pat Phoenix (who had already appeared as a cover star on the 1985 single ""Shakespeare\'s Sister"") and Cicely Courtneidge as an elderly lesbian veteran of the music halls. The soundbite is Courtneidge\'s character nostalgically singing the World War I song ""Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty"". The actress had also appeared in a gala performance for Elizabeth II\'s Silver Jubilee called ""God Save the Queen"", and died in 1980.\n\nA few songs, including ""The Queen Is Dead"" and ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", feature pitch-shifted backing vocals by Morrissey. Morrissey liked to experiment with effects on his voice, so Street ran his voice through a harmoniser for the backing tracks. Street recalled, ""At that time, apart from the harmoniser, he didn\'t go for much backing vocal or harmony work — he\'s done that more on recent albums — but he did like to experiment"".

West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.\n\nThe production is notably more lush and elaborate than West\'s previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.\n\nThe album produced five singles, including the international hits ""Touch the Sky"", ""Heard \'Em Say"" and ""Gold Digger"", the last of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. The album has sold over 3.1 million units in the United States and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nUpon its release, Late Registration received rave reviews from music critics and earned West several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards and an Album of the Year nomination. It appeared at the top of several publications year-end lists of top albums. Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2005, and included it at number 118 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Late+Registration"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was at #1 for eight weeks in early 1977 (non-consecutively), and included two tracks which became #1 hits as singles on the Billboard Hot 100: ""New Kid in Town"", on February 26, 1977, and ""Hotel California"" on May 7, 1977.\n\nIn 2001 the TV network VH1 named Hotel California #38 on 100 Greatest Albums of all time. Hotel California was ranked 13th in a 2005 survey held by British television\'s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 37 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nFollowing its original release on standard LP, cassette and 8-track cartridge formats, the album was slated for Quadraphonic release in early 1977; this idea was ultimately dropped following the demise of the Quadraphonic format. However, 25 years later, the album was released in a Multichannel 5.1 DVD-Audio disc.\n\nHotel California touched on many themes, including insanity, innocence (and the loss thereof), death, the dangers, drug addiction, temptation and transient nature of fame, shallow relationships, divorce and loss of love, the end results of manifest destiny, and the ""American Dream.""\n\nMembers of Eagles have described the album as a metaphor for the perceived decline of America into materialism and decadence. In an interview with Dutch magazine ZigZag shortly before the album\'s release, Don Henley said:\n“ \tThis is a concept album, there\'s no way to hide it, but it\'s not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know. It\'s more urban this time (. . . ) It\'s our bicentennial year, you know, the country is 200 years old, so we figured since we are the Eagles and the Eagle is our national symbol, that we were obliged to make some kind of a little bicentennial statement using California as a microcosm of the whole United States, or the whole world, if you will, and to try to wake people up and say \'We\'ve been okay so far, for 200 years, but we\'re gonna have to change if we\'re gonna continue to be around.\' \t”\n\n\nThe album\'s final track, the epic ""The Last Resort"", was about the demise of society. Glenn Frey on the Hotel California episode of In the Studio with Redbeard explained about the track:\n“ \tIt was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment...we\'re constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we\'re putting junk, er, garbage into space now. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles/Hotel+California"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Halo 8"" of the official Nine Inch Nails halo releases, it is a concept album detailing the destruction of an undisclosed man; from the beginning to his climatic suicide. The album was a major commercial success that secured Nine Inch Nails as a force in the 1990s music scene, in particular following the release of the single ""Closer"" and its controversial video.\n\nTo record the album, Reznor rented the house located at 10050 Cielo Drive in Beverly Hills, California where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969. Reznor built a studio space in the house which he named Le Pig, after the message that was scrawled on the front door with Tate\'s blood by her murderers. Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because, ""I looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most."" Reznor moved out of the house in December 1993, after he said ""there was too much history in that house for me to handle."" After the album\'s recording, Trent Reznor consulted with the landlords and had the house demolished shortly after.\n\nReznor made a statement about working in the Tate house during a 1997 interview with Rolling Stone:\n\n“ While I was working on Downward Spiral, I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: \'Are you exploiting my sister\'s death by living in her house?\' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, \'No, it\'s just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I\'m in this place where a weird part of history occurred.\' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don\'t want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, \'What if it was my sister?\' I thought, \'Fuck Charlie Manson.\' I went home and cried that night. It made me see there\'s another side to things, you know? ” \n\nReznor set out to make an album that was a departure from the 1992 Broken EP, emphasizing ""mood, texture, restraint and subtlety."" He brought in a number of guest performers to record, including former Jane\'s Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins and progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew. Perkins played a number of drum parts that were recorded live in the studio; these tracks were in turn turned into sample loops. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts. Reznor would record 20 to 25-minute long sessions of himself playing guitar on a hard disc recorder with a Studio Vision sequencer, then would cut out parts of the recording he found interesting for later use. Reznor said, ""99 percent of the stuff we do–even vocals–is recorded into the computer  first. We get an arrangement together and then dump it to tape.""\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/The+Downward+Spiral"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1970, art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Led Zeppelin II. On 15 November 1999, it was certified 12x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 12 million copies. Following its initial reception, it has been recognized by writers and music critics as one of the greatest and most influential rock albums recorded. Led Zeppelin II has also been cited by critics as a blueprint for heavy metal bands that followed it.

The album arrived nearly two years after lead vocalist Bono announced the band would have to ""go away and dream it all up again"", following the mixed response to 1988\'s Rattle and Hum. While recording Achtung Baby, there was a rift between band members over the direction of the band\'s sound. Tensions almost prompted U2 to break-up until the band rallied around the writing of the album\'s hit One.\n\nThe album marks a dramatic change in the band\'s image and sound, with the band being heavily influenced by alternative rock and electronic music. Their music also features more detailed production, more guitar effects, and darker, more personal lyrical content. The results were considerably more adventurous than their previous efforts, yet Achtung Baby was very commercially and critically successful, winning a Grammy Award and having sold approximately 18 million copies worldwide. In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe band embarked on the elaborately-staged, multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour to support the album.\n\nHistory\nAchtung Baby was a departure for the band. Bono has often described the album as ""the sound of four men trying to chop down The Joshua Tree"". U2 sampled techniques and sounds from other musical genres previously unused by the band, including dance, house and electronica, whilst maintaining their original feel of rock and roll.\n\nThe album\'s new sound was a source of conflict in the band because The Edge and Bono favored the new sounds they were coming up with while recording their sessions in Berlin, while drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton were partial to the band\'s traditional sound. The conflict amongst the members of U2 very nearly led to the band breaking up, but the fighting subdued after The Edge, struggling with two bridge sections for the song Ultraviolet (Light My Way) was encouraged to combine them by the band and producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. The band rallied around the riff and was inspired to write the song One. It changed the band\'s outlook on the album, helping bring them back from the brink during recording sessions. One was responsible for a renewed sense of optimism towards the material they had already recorded. Leaving Berlin on a high note, the band was able to complete the rest of the album in Dublin.\n\nAchtung Baby was also darker sounding than previous efforts, thanks in large part to songs such as The Fly, Acrobat, and Love Is Blindness, which deal with themes of helplessness, broken relationships, and (in the case of Love Is Blindness) violence in the name of love. The spiritual yearning of U2\'s 1980s work began to take on a more existential, despairing element in Achtung Baby. The band\'s political activism moved to the AIDS crisis and environmental issues. At the same time, the band also took on a lighter tone, electing to use irony rather than earnestness in its music and public appearances, and poking fun at its own self-importance during the 1980s. This evolving outlook culminated in the pleaful soul-searching (and jaded skewering of contemporary life) on 1997\'s Pop and would not subside until the more hopeful tracks on 2000\'s All That You Can\'t Leave Behind.\n\nOther tracks included the distorted opener Zoo Station, the danceable single Even Better Than The Real Thing, and the thumping rocker (and future live favourite) Until the End of the World, written for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders\' eponymous 1991 science fiction film. The song may be an allegorical afterlife confession of Judas Iscariot.\n\nAchtung Baby expanded the group\'s fanbase. New fans were perhaps drawn in by the hit song Mysterious Ways and the ballad One.\n\nThe album was followed by the Zoo TV Tour, a ground-breaking and, in Zoo TV: Live from Sydney, Grammy-award winning multimedia concert production.\n\nThe U.S. LP is the only American release to contain the uncensored picture of bassist Adam Clayton naked. On the U.S. CD and cassette, his private parts are censored with a black ""X"" or a four-leaf clover.\n\nAs for the album\'s title, ""Achtung, Baby!"" in German means ""Attention, baby!"" or ""Careful, baby!"" Frequently used by the band\'s engineers during the making of the album, the phrase came from the Mel Brooks film The Producers.\n\nAchtung Baby was the first of 9 albums to feature 3 songs to reach the top of the Modern Rock Tracks.\n\nReception\nOn the Billboard Music Charts (North America), Achtung Baby topped the Billboard 200 chart selling 295,000 copies in its first week. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Rolling Stone magazine declared that U2 had ""proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll.""\n\nThe album is frequently cited as one of the greatest in rock history. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Achtung Baby the 15th greatest album of all time; in 2001 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 65. Also in 2003, Q declared its third track, One, ""the greatest recorded song of all time"". In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was voted #11 on Spin\'s ""Best Albums of the Last 25 Years"" list. In a 2007 VH1 countdown, One was named the #2 on its list of ""Songs of the 1990s"". Entertainment Weekly named Achtung Baby the #3 album of the last 25 years.\n\nStudio bootlegs\n\nU2 entered the studio in late 1990 and began recording the album before they had written any material, mainly improvising and developing ideas into songs. The more interesting ideas were preserved on working tapes. In April 1991, these tapes fell into the hands of bootleggers, well before the album\'s November release date. The most widely circulated compilation of these tapes is the three-disc Salomé: The Axtung Beibi Outtakes, released in February 1992. Another bootleg surfaced, entitled, The Achtung Sessions in 1993.\n\nLater that same year, another single disc bootleg of the tapes was distributed underground. Called , this single disc contained material of songs that were near completion. Most notably; Heaven and Hell, The Darkest Night, and Blow Your House Down. Interestingly, none of the ""Salome"" mixes were included on this disc.\n\nSince these songs were leaked very early in the production process, they provide a rare insight into the band\'s songwriting process. On the same note, many of the ideas—including eight different takes of the song ""Salomé""—were frustratingly undeveloped, so the bootleg remains a curiosity strictly for hardcore fans. Bono says, ""There were no undiscovered works of genius, unfortunately, it was more just gobbledy-gook.""\n\nSome of the ideas were revisited—there are, for instance, early instrumental versions of Even Better Than the Real Thing and North and South of the River (the latter of which wouldn\'t be recorded by the band until 1997)—and one song—the B-side Where Did It All Go Wrong?—was even officially released as a rough composite of the two takes available on the bootleg. There are also a handful of developed ideas that were wholly abandoned, such as She\'s Gonna Blow Your House Down, a song the group had been working on since the Rattle and Hum days.\n\nVideo\nFollowing the successful release of the album, U2 released Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV, a VHS compilation of music videos from the album. The compilation featured nine videos, including three videos for both One and Even Better than the Real Thing. In between the videos were clips of ""interference"" — documentary footage, media clips, and other images, similar to what was shown at shows during the Zoo TV Tour. The videos for Who\'s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses and Love Is Blindness were the only videos from the album not included on this release, as they were not released until after the compilation\'s release.\n\nProfessional Reviews\nAllMusic - ★★★★★\nRolling Stone - ★★★★☆\nThe Boston Globe\nEntertainment Weekly\nTrouser Press <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/U2/Achtung+Baby"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With the help of the album\'s four charting singles, Charles earned recognition in the pop market, as well as airplay on both R&B and country radio stations. Modern Sounds and its lead single, ""I Can\'t Stop Loving You"", were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1962, as each record had shipped 500,000 copies in the United States.\n\nRegarded by many critics as Charles\'s best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music has been considered by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album\'s integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid the height of the Civil Rights Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/Modern+Sounds+in+Country+and+Western+Music"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was originally released by EMI in the UK where it topped the charts for nine weeks, a record at the time, and Elektra Records in the United States where the album peaked at #4 and has been certified Triple Platinum (three million copies sold).\nThe album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. The 1976 follow-up album, A Day at the Races, was also named after a Marx brothers film.\n\nAt the time the most expensive album ever recorded, Brian May has asserted in subsequent years that the band would have disbanded had it not been successful. Upon release, A Night at the Opera was a commercial and critical success, debuting at #1 in the UK charts and remaining there for nine weeks. In the US, it debuted at #4, the band\'s strongest showing at that time. Reviews were generally positive. Rolling Stone wrote: ""What sets them apart is their selection of unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, acapella vocals, no synthesizers. Coupled with good songs. Queen\'s obviously the strongest contender in its field."" Melody Maker called the album a ""must-have,"" encouraging listeners to ""turn it up loud and enjoy,"" while the Winnipeg Free Press wrote: ""The group\'s potential is practically limitless, indicating that Queen is destined to finally take its place among the small handful of truly major acts working in rock today."" Robert Christgau, however, was less enthusiastic, giving the album a ""B-"" rating. Later reviews in notable publications such as Allmusic, Mojo and Q Magazine, have seen the album receive five-star ratings. Allmusic wrote: ""It\'s prog rock with a sense of humor as well as dynamics, and Queen never bettered their approach anywhere else."" Mojo called the album ""An imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia; a band of hungrily competitive individualists on a big roll of friendship and delight."" Q were similarly receptive, writing: ""It\'s a record to which all four contributed fine songs, and one of extremes -- among the crashing rock and proggy wigouts were love songs, acoustic whimsy, a trad-jazz pastiche and a brace of vaudeville show tunes."" Uncut awarded the album only 3/5 stars, but offered a mostly positive review, commending ""the extent of the band\'s barmy diversity.""\n\nSince its release, A Night at the Opera has frequently been cited as one of Queen\'s finest works. In particular, Bohemian Rhapsody, the album\'s centerpiece, received acclaim and is still considered among the greatest songs ever recorded. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll, and the 9th greatest number one album of all time in a 2006 BBC poll. The album has also ranked highly in international polls and has frequently appeared in ""greatest albums"" lists reflecting the opinions of critics.\n\nA Night at the Opera appears alongside other Queen albums Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nThe album was first time re-released in the US on Hollywood Records on 3 September 1991 with two bonus remixes, as part of a complete re-release of all Queen albums.\n\nOn 30 April 2002 the album was again re-released on DVD-Audio with a 5.1-channel mix in Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound.\n\nOn 21 November 2005 it was once more re-released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album and its first single, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". This release is accompanied by a DVD-Video disc with the same track listing featuring the original videos, old and new concert footage (including ""\'39"" from the Queen + Paul Rodgers tour and Brian May on the roof of Buckingham Palace playing ""God Save the Queen"") and audio commentary by all four bandmembers. It was on this commentary (and on In the Studio with Redbeard, which devoted an episode to A Night at the Opera) that May stated that had the album not been a success, Queen certainly would have disbanded. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/A+Night+at+the+Opera"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into a film.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their previous albums, The Wall is a concept album — specifically, it deals largely with the theme of isolation from one\'s peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band\'s 1977 tour promoting the album Animals, with regards to an incident where Roger Waters\' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme, The Wall featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.\n\nThe Wall is a rock opera that centres on the character ""Pink"". Largely based on Waters\' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war (""Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)""), abused by teachers (""The Happiest Days of Our Lives""), nurtured by an overprotective mother (""Mother""), and deserted by his wife later on (""Don\'t Leave Me Now"") — all of which factored into Pink\'s mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as ""The Wall"". Once Pink is behind his Wall, he slowly becomes insane due to his isolation from his fellow man. This culminates at a concert held by Pink, where he sets his ""men"" on fans he deems unworthy. He then puts himself on trial (""The Trial"") and finds himself guilty for causing his problems. The album then ends with a monologue by Waters; the fate of Pink is unknown.\n\nThe Wall quickly became a bestseller and was eventually certified 26x platinum. It is the Floyd\'s second-best-selling album after Dark Side of the Moon. However, The Wall contributed heavily to the split in the group that came soon after its release. Roger Waters (lead vocalist) fired keyboardist Rick Wright part way through the recording sessions and assumed most of the creative control over the album. Pink Floyd produced just one more album, The Final Cut, which was practically a Waters solo project, before Rogers finally left the band in the early 80\'s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Wall"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recording sessions took place from July to November of 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin. The album features the band\'s exploration of roots rock, with their music exhibiting influences from blues-rock, folk rock, Southern rock, and gospel music. Lyrically, The Joshua Tree depicts the band\'s fascination with America and many of the ideas it stands for. The album was produced and engineered by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.\n\nThe album increased the band\'s stature ""from heroes to superstars,"" according to Rolling Stone. The album produced several hit singles, including ""Where the Streets Have No Name"", ""With or Without You"", and ""I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For"", all of which remain radio staples. The Joshua Tree won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Album of the Year in Grammy Awards of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". The album is one of the world\'s best-selling albums of all-time, having sold over 28 million copies. In 2007, a remastered version of the album was released to mark the 20th anniversary of its original release.\n\nFollowing The Unforgettable Fire album, U2 realised that they ""had no tradition, we were from outer space"", and they explored American blues, country and gospel music. Since that album, they had spent time with fellow Irish bands The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, and felt a sense of indigenous Irish music being blended with American folk music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Keith Richards encouraged the band to look back to the roots of rock music, and focused Bono on his skills as a song and lyric writer. The band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire\'s atmospherics, but also sought a more hard-hitting sound within the strict discipline of more conventional song structures, in contrast to The Unforgettable Fire\'s often out-of-focus experimentation.\n\nThe band interrupted their 1986 album sessions to join Amnesty International\'s A Conspiracy of Hope Tour. Rather than being a distraction, the band found the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music, providing extra focus on what they wanted to say. The album sessions for The Joshua Tree proper began in July 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin.\n\nIn his earlier 1986 travels to Central America, Bono saw first hand the distress of peasants bullied in political conflicts, and this was a central influence on the album. The United States\' military intervention in El Salvador angered Bono and prompted him to ask The Edge to ""put El Salvador through an amplifier"" for the song ""Bullet the Blue Sky"". ""Mothers of the Disappeared"" was inspired by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the mothers of the thousands of ""disappeared"" people who opposed the Videla and Galtieri coup d\'état that overtook Argentina in 1976, and who were kidnapped and never seen again.\n\nThe album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States, including anger at United States foreign policy in Central America, against the band\'s deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom and what it stood for. The band wanted music with a sense of location, a \'cinematic\' quality; its music and lyrics drew on imagery created by American writers the band had been reading. The band had toured in the United States extensively, which affected the band; according to Bono, the album was inspired and influenced more by the country\'s geography, rather than its people. Bono said he ""...had to \'deal with\' the United States and the way it was affecting me, because the United States\' having such an effect on the world at the moment. On this record I had to deal with it on a political level for the first time, if in a subtle way."" Since Bono was trying to portray the both ""mythic idea of America"" and the ""reality of America"" on the album, the working title of the album was ""The Two Americas"".\n\nThe record was also influenced by the blues. While in recording sessions for the b-side ""Silver and Gold"", working with Keith Richards, Bono and Richards listened to blues music, country music, American pop music from the 1950s, and other such influences. These influences, combined with Bono\'s early influences, such as Patti Smith and Bob Dylan, had an effect on the song and the whole album.\n\n""Where the Streets Have No Name"" was conceived prior to one of the Joshua Tree recording sessions by guitarist The Edge. Bono conceived the lyrics with the idea that one could determine a person\'s religion and income based on where they lived in Belfast. While recording the song as a band, however, U2 ran into difficulty. The song\'s frequent chord and time changes caused problems in playing the song correctly; the difficulty was so great that producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the track. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, ""It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it\'s not half the song it is live.""\n\n""I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For"" grew from another song called ""Under the Weather Girls"", which co-producer Daniel Lanois didn\'t like, except for Larry Mullen, Jr.\'s drum track and Adam Clayton\'s bass line. These parts were used as the foundation of ""I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For"". The development of the song saw the addition of such things as a subtle auto-pan effect added to one of The Edge\'s guitar overdubs and Bono, a tenor, singing in the upper register of his range to add to the feeling of spiritual yearning. Both Bono and Edge have, in fact, called it a gospel song on numerous occasions.\n\n""With or Without You"", the album\'s first single and one of the band\'s most well-known songs, uses an effect called ""infinite guitar"", developed by Michael Brook, to infinitely sustain notes.\n\nThe band concluded recording of the album in November 1986.\n\nA number of songs that were released as B-sides to singles from The Joshua Tree are thought to have been considered for a double-album version of The Joshua Tree. Though Bono was the most vocal proponent of this extended version of the album, The Edge successfully argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released. ""Spanish Eyes"" and ""Deep in the Heart"" were released as B-sides to the ""I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For"" single. ""Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)"" and ""Walk to the Water"" were released as B-sides to the ""With or Without You"" single. ""Sweetest Thing"", ""Silver and Gold"", and ""Race Against Time"" were released as B-sides to the ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" single.\n\nThe Joshua Tree was first released on 9 March 1987. The album cover photo was taken by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn in December 1986. Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in Death Valley, California; ""This is the most serious set of shots I have taken of U2 and they became my most well-known photographs at the time. It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in America.""\n\nIn 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Four different formats of the remaster were made available.\n\n""With or Without You"" and the rhythmic gospel ""I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For"" were released as singles internationally and quickly went to #1 in the U.S. ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" was also successfully released. ""In God\'s Country"" was released as a fourth single in North America with modest success, while ""One Tree Hill"" was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand. Initially slated as a single release, ""Red Hill Mining Town"" was the only track from the album not played on the tour. Bono has suggested that the song\'s high notes put too much strain on his voice.\n\nUpon its release, The Joshua Tree debuted at #1 in the UK and also quickly reached the top of the charts in the U.S. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine (following The Beatles, The Band, and The Who), who declared that U2 was ""Rock\'s Hottest Ticket"". The album brought U2 to a new level of mega-stardom, as the worldwide Joshua Tree Tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size.\n\nThe Joshua Tree won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, with the band receiving honors for ""Album of the Year"" and ""Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal"".\n\nAccording to U.S. Recording Industry sales figures, as of January 2005, The Joshua Tree ranks as the 89th best-selling album of all-time in the U.S. and, as of 2006, the 26th best-selling album in the U.K.. The album has sold 10 million copies in the United States alone and more than 25 million copies worldwide. It remains the band\'s best-selling album.\n\nThe Joshua Tree is often cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 1989, it was rated #3 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of ""The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80\'s"", as well as appearing at #26 on the magazine\'s ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". The Definitive 200 list sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ranks the album as the fifth-greatest in history. The Joshua Tree was selected as #6 on CCM Magazine\'s 2001 list of the greatest Contemporary Christian music albums of all time (see CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music). It came second place in Channel 4\'s 100 Greatest albums. It came in at #10 on ABC Television\'s My Favourite Album program, which aired in Australia in December 2006. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The instrumental title track is the key reason to listen, specifically for Eddie Hazel\'s lengthy, mind-melting solo. George Clinton famously told Hazel to play ""like your mama had just died,"" and the resulting evocation of melancholy and sorrow doesn\'t merely rival Jimi Hendrix\'s work, but arguably bests a lot of it. Accompanied by another softer guitar figure providing gentle rhythm for the piece, the end result is simply fantastic: an emotional apocalypse of sound. Maggot Brain is bookended by another long number, ""Wars of Armageddon,"" a full-on jam from the band looping in freedom chants and airport-departure announcements to the freak-out. In between are a number of short pieces, finding the collective merrily cooking up some funky stew of the slow and smoky variety. There are folky blues and gospel testifying on ""Can You Get to That"" (one listen and a lot of Primal Scream\'s mid-\'90s career is instantly explained) and wry but warm reflections on interracial love on ""You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks,"" its drum hits distorted to give a weird electronic edge to the results. ""Super Stupid"" is a particular killer, pounding drums and snarling guitar laying down the boogie hard and hot, while ""Hit It and Quit It"" has a great chorus and Bernie Worrell getting in a fun keyboard solo to boot. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Funkadelic/Maggot+Brain"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Composed in the aftermath of the singer\'s separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele\'s vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world\'s best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. In addition, it had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a woman. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the ""Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time.""\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album, with Rolling in the Deep, Someone like You and Set Fire to the Rain becoming international number-one songs, while Rumour Has It charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, 21 is one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The title of the album is a loose pun of the Immaculate Conception, the conception of the Virgin Mary without any stain of the original sin. This name follows Madonna\'s religious-themed songs and videos, as well as the second section of her Blond Ambition World Tour, which also employed religious motifs. An extended play titled The Holiday Collection was issued in Europe to accompany the compilation and the re-release of the single ""Holiday"". It is the first album ever to use an audio technology called QSound.\n\nThe album was ranked at number one on the Blender magazine\'s list of ""100 Greatest American Albums of All Time"". In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the 184th greatest album of all time. It became Madonna\'s second album to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of over 10 million copies across the United States. It spent the second highest number of consecutive weeks at number one for a female solo artist in the U.K., being at number one for a 9 week stint. The album has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist and one of the best selling albums of all time. ""Justify My Love"", the album\'s first single, became Madonna\'s ninth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and was one of her most controversial singles due to its sexually explicit music video. ""Rescue Me"" was released as the second single and became the highest-debuting single on Hot 100 by a female artist at that time, entering the chart at number fifteen and peaking at number nine. Due to space restrictions, the compilation excludes several of her top 10 hits of the 80\'s, such as ""Angel"", ""Dress You Up"", ""True Blue"", ""Who\'s That Girl"", ""Causing a Commotion"", ""Keep It Together"" and ""Hanky Panky"".\n\nOriginally titled Ultra Madonna, the name was changed as Warner Bros. felt that it was too similar to the name of dance artist Ultra Naté. Madonna dedicated the album to ""The Pope, my divine inspiration"". This led to many believing it was dedicated to Pope John Paul II, but it was actually dedicated to her brother, Christopher Ciccone, who had spent the year on tour with Madonna (""The Pope"" is one of his nicknames). The production of this album is notable for its use of QSound; all songs were mixed in using it, except ""Justify My Love"" and ""Rescue Me"". A QSound mix of ""Justify My Love"" was later released on the US maxi-single to the song.\n\nAll of the songs on The Immaculate Collection (with the exception of the two new songs) were remixed by Shep Pettibone alongside either Goh Hotoda or Michael Hutchinson and some were also edited down from their original lengths in order to decrease the overall running time. While all the vocals remain the same as in the original recordings, ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Express Yourself"" feature different music backing Madonna\'s vocals than their original album release. It was decided that a mixture of ballads and pop-dance hits would be included, although there wasn\'t space for every single that Madonna had released. ""Justify My Love"" became the first single to promote the album, and created a furor over the sexual video and the controversy in regards to who wrote it; poet Ingrid Chavez claimed she wrote part of the lyrics alongside credited lyricist Lenny Kravitz. The single shot to number one in the U.S. and number two in the UK. A second release, ""Rescue Me"", was released in early 1991, which also went top ten.\n\nWarner Bros. released an EP in the UK and Europe titled The Holiday Collection which had the same design as The Immaculate Collection. The full-length version of ""Holiday"" was included alongside ""True Blue"", ""Who\'s That Girl"", and the Silver Screen Single mix of ""Causing a Commotion"". The re-released ""Holiday"" eventually went to No. 5 in the UK charts, while a re-release of the ballad ""Crazy for You"" (using the new remixed version) peaked at No. 2. Blender magazine ranked the album at number one on their list of ""100 Greatest American Albums of All Time"". In 2003, the album was ranked number 278 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In November 2006, the album was confirmed by the British Phonographic Industry to be the biggest selling album by a solo female artist in British history, and the tenth biggest selling album of all time in the UK by any artist. On December 11, 1990, a box set entitled The Royal Box was released which included either a Cassette/VHS (US-only) or Satin CD Digipak/VHS (US, Germany/UK) with additional postcards and poster. The VHS version also included the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards performance of ""Vogue"".\n\nThe Immaculate Collection stayed atop the UK Albums chart for nine weeks, becoming the biggest selling UK album in 1990, also breaking the record for the longest consecutive weeks at #1 by a solo female artist, a record that would not be matched until 2011 by Adele\'s album 21. On March 12, 2006, the album re-entered the UK charts more than 15 years after its release at #38 (it reached #1 on its original release in 1990).Madonna\'s Confessions on a Dance Floor was also in the top 20 at #13. In 2006, the album returned to Ireland\'s Top 100 Albums chart, entering at #21, charting higher than Confessions on a Dance Floor, which was at #95. On the week of April 28, 2008, the album rose 50 places from #122 to #72 on the official UK Albums Chart, the same week that Madonna\'s eleventh studio album Hard Candy was released internationally.\n\nIn the United States, The Immaculate Collection was certified Diamond (10× Platinum) by RIAA, becoming one of the best-selling albums in the country. In the United Kingdom, The Immaculate Collection was certified 12× Platinum by BPI for shipment of 3.6 million copies. It remained the best-selling album by a female artist in the United Kingdom for eleven years, until the release of Adele\'s 21 (2011).\n\nThe Immaculate Collection was certified 12× Platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association, becoming one of the best-selling albums in Australia. In France, the album was certified Diamond for shipment of one million copies of the album. The Immaculate Collection has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it Madonna\'s best-seller and one of the world\'s best-selling albums of all time. It also remains the best-selling compilation album ever released by a solo artist. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/The+Immaculate+Collection"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It has been certified quadruple platinum with over four million copies in the US alone, making it Black Sabbath\'s best-selling album.\n\nThe ""Paranoid"" single, released before the album, reached number four in the UK. Pushed by its success, the album hit number one in the UK, and is the only Black Sabbath album to have done so. The US release was held until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of Paranoid\'s UK release. The album broke into the top ten in the US in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the US alone, with virtually no radio airplay. Paranoid\'s chart success in the US allowed the band to tour there for the first time in December 1970. This spawned the release of the album\'s second single ""Iron Man"", and although it failed to reach the top 40, ""Iron Man"" remains one of Black Sabbath\'s most popular songs.\n\nThe album was again panned by music critics of the era. However, modern-day music critics are much more favourable towards the album than those of the time. An example is Allmusic\'s Steve Huey, who cites Paranoid as ""one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time"", which ""defined the sound and style of metal, more than any other record in history"".\n\n    * In 1999, Q magazine (12/99, p.170) included it in their list of The Best Gothic Albums Of All Time, writing that, "" stamped their bombastic and doom-laden imprint on British rock forever.""\n    * In 1999, Vibe (12/99, p.162) included it on their list of 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n    * In 2003, the album was ranked number 130 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n    * In 2006, the album was ranked number 6 on Guitar World magazine\'s list of The Greatest 100 Guitar Albums of All Time.\n    * As of January 2009, the album is # 60 on Rate Your Music\'s Top Albums of All Time list and #2 on their Best Albums of 1970 ranking. \n\nAfter the release of their eponymous debut album in February 1970, Black Sabbath returned to the studio in June that year, again with producer Rodger Bain, to record their second album. The album was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England. The album\'s eponymous single ""Paranoid"" was written in the studio at the last minute. As drummer Bill Ward explains: ""We didn\'t have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the ""Paranoid"" guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom."" The song was written with no intention of it being a successful hit for the band, only to be a filler on the album.\n\nThe album was originally titled War Pigs, but allegedly the record company changed it to Paranoid, fearing backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. At the time, the band felt that the song was lighter, with the potential to become a single. However, the band\'s visual interpretation of a ""war pig"" was still featured on the cover; a distorted, eerie photograph of a man with sword and shield jumping out from behind a tree. This image confused many of the band\'s fans, who thought that the image did not resemble the album title to any extent.\n\nThe original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve. The inner of the gatefold had a black and white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill, and was their first appearance on album artwork. To spread the original picture over the gatefold, Ozzy Osbourne was separated from the other members of the band and a section of the grass was copied and dropped into the gap. This is only readily apparent if one compares it with the original photograph.\n\nIn comparison with their previous album, the songs on Paranoid were given more focus and direction, with less improvisation. However the lyrical content is equally as dark, exploring themes such as war, mental illness, drug abuse and sci-fi horror. Much of the album could be viewed as a kind of social commentary. Spin magazine wrote that the band ""saw heavy rock as a way to emulate the horrors of a fallen world.""\n\nThe lyrics of the opening song, ""War Pigs"", discuss war and the absurdities of those who make war without regard for those forced to fight it. It is often viewed as a protest song. Similarly, the lyrics of ""Electric Funeral"" discuss the bleak aftermath of nuclear warfare. These songs were written in the midst of the Vietnam War and the Cold War, and could be seen as quite representative of the political situation at the time.\n\nThe song ""Paranoid"" is uncharacteristically fast and simplistic for Black Sabbath in their early days. Supposedly the band members intended it only as an interlude or as ""filler"". Its lyrics concern the stigma of mental illness. In a related way, ""Iron Man"" is about a time traveller from the future who has been turned to steel. He is outcast by society but eventually takes his revenge on humanity. It is also a reference to Vietnam war veterans, who upon returning from war were outcast by society and had no help re-integrating into normal life or dealing with their post war mental disorders.\n\nThe song ""Iron Man"" is thematically very similar to the Ted Hughes novel, The Iron Man. This book was made into an animated film which was called The Iron Giant.\n\nThree songs on the album appear to concern dreams, hallucinations and drug use. ""Planet Caravan"" and ""Fairies Wear Boots"" are quite psychedelic in style and their lyrics are quite abstract. ""Hand of Doom"" was written as a message against heroin use. The song transitions between slow, soft passages and fast, loud passages as a representation of the drug being injected. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/Paranoid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is number 123 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the second highest placement of the four Bob Marley albums on the list.\n\nOn completion, the master tapes were taken to the UK for remixing, and Chris Blackwell enlisted the help of two US musicians - making an ""English"" version of the album. Wayne Perkins re-did some of the rhythm/ lead guitar, whilst John ""Rabbit"" Bundrick added some organ, electric piano, clavinet and synthesizer.\n\nThe first 20,000 copies of the original 1973 vinyl release, designed by graphical artists Rod Dyer and Bob Weiner, were encased in a sleeve depicting a Zippo lighter. The sleeve functioned as a real Zippo lighter case, opening at a side hinge to reveal the record within. As machinery available was not sufficient to rivet the upper and lower halves of the sleeve together, the assembly operation required hand-manufacture and was deemed too expensive to mass-produce. Hence, subsequent pressings are recognizable by their alternate cover art containing an Ester Anderson portrait of Marley smoking a joint. Copies of the record from these original pressings have since become collectors\' items. The original cover art was used again in 2001 for the Deluxe compact disc edition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wailers/Catch+A+Fire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album\'s offbeat and dark subject material, featuring references to surrealism, Biblical violence, torture and death, contrasts with the clean production sound achieved by the then newly hired producer Gil Norton. Along with Surfer Rosa, Doolittle is considered the band\'s strongest work.\n\nDoolittle has continued to sell consistently well in the nineteen years since its release, and in 1995 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album has been cited as inspirational by many alternative artists, while numerous music publications have ranked it as one of the most influential albums ever. A 2003 poll of NME writers ranked Doolittle as the second greatest album of all time. Reaction to Doolittle was positive in general, with the album garnering praise from several major music publications. NME commented that ""the songs on Doolittle have the power to make you literally jump out of your skin with excitement."" Q, giving the album four stars out of five, said that Doolittle\'s ""carefully structured noise and straightforward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense."" Tim Rolston, of the Daily Telegraph praised Doolittle as ""a scintillating rock\'n\'roll album"" and the Pixies\' ""finest half-hour so far."" Other publications also awarded the album four out of five stars, including the British music weekly Record Mirror, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune. The Village Voice\'s Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ rating, suggesting that ""getting famous too fast could ruin them.""\n\nHowever, Doolittle received mixed reviews from several music critics. Time Out said that ""Gil Norton\'s toy theatre production makes a drama out of what should have been a crisis."" Spin ran a hundred-word review of the album, including critic Joe Levy\'s comment ""the insanity less surreal and more silly, and the songs themselves more like songs and less like adventures."" Rolling Stone, reviewing the album in July 1988, gave the album three and a half stars. Doolittle appeared on several end-of-year ""Best Album"" lists; both Rolling Stone and The Village Voice placed the album tenth, and independent music magazines Sounds and Melody Maker both ranked the album as the second best of the year. NME also ranked the album highly, placing it fourth in their end-of-year list.\n\nA range of music magazines have since acclaimed Doolittle as one of the quintessential alternative rock albums of the 1980s. Rolling Stone, reviewing Doolittle again in 2002, gave the album five stars out of five, remarking that it laid the ""groundwork for Nineties rock."" Doolittle has received a number of international accolades and is consistently noted as one of the best albums of the 1980s in any genre.\n\n\nFollowing its release, Doolittle sold steadily in America, and broke sales of 100,000 after six months. By early 1992, while the band were supporting U2 on their Zoo TV Tour, the album was selling 1,500 copies a week. The middle of 1993, two years after the band\'s last album, Trompe le Monde, saw sales average 1,200 copies per week. Doolittle was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1995. Ten years after the breakup, Doolittle was still selling between 500 and 1,000 copies a week; the reunion tour saw sales creep back up to 1,200 copies a week. At the end of 2005, best estimates put total sales in America at between 800,000 and one million copies.\n\nDoolittle features an eclectic mix of musical styles. While tracks such as ""Tame"" and ""Crackity Jones"" are fast and aggressive, and incorporate the band\'s trademark loud-quiet dynamic; other songs such as ""Silver,"" ""I Bleed,"" and ""Here Comes Your Man"" reveal a quieter, slower and more melodic temperament. With Doolittle, the band began to incorporate further instruments into their sound. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features two violins and two cellos; while other tracks on Doolittle are constructed around simple chord progressions.\n\n""Tame"" is based on a three chord formula; including Joey Santiago\'s playing a ""Hendrix chord"" over the main bass progression. ""I Bleed"" is melodically simple, and is formed around a single rhythmical repetition. Some songs are influenced by other genres of music; while ""Crackity Jones"" has a distinctly Spanish sound, and incorporates G# and A triads over a C# pedal, the song\'s rhythm guitar, played by Francis, starts with an eighth-note downstroke typical of punk rock music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Doolittle"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Often considered his most popular and commercial triumph, it saw Springsteen (in contrast to his previous album, the critical favorite Nebraska) experimenting with anthemic arrangements and a 1980s production incorporating a radio-friendly sound that was embraced warmly by both critics and the audience. Springsteen also delivered a new look to his public – he was reintroduced as a tougher and muscular rock star after two years of running and bodybuilding. These efforts and innovative strategies resulted in Springsteen\'s peak of commercial success – it was the best-selling album of 1985 in the United States, produced a record-tying string of seven Top 10 singles (the most for a rock album in history) and became the best-selling album of Springsteen\'s career. In addition, it was supported with the highly successful two-year Born in the U.S.A. Tour. As part of its enduring popularity, the album impacted as a cultural phenomenon, with its title track often misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem and its cover (a close-up of a rear Springsteen in front of an American flag, as he was photographed by Annie Leibovitz) became one of the most recognizable images in American popular culture.\n\nIn 1981, Springsteen was asked to write some music for a film by Paul Schrader called Born in the U.S.A. Shortly after, when Springsteen was working on a song titled Vietnam, he glanced at the script and sang the title. The song, entitled as the work-in-progress movie, was already finished during the sessions of Springsteen\'s introspective album Nebraska, and Springsteen originally wanted to included on it. However, it was removed as it did not coincided with the dark feel of the rest of the songs. The same happened with other songs already cut around January or February 1982 – the energetic rocker ""Cover Me"" and the intimate ""I\'m on Fire"". Then, between April and May, Springsteen composed and recorded a number of songs specifically intended for an album besides Nebraska at The Power Station in New York – ""Born in the U.S.A."", ""Darlington County"", ""Working on the Highway"", ""Downbound Train"", ""I\'m Goin\' Down"" and ""Glory Days"". By mid-1982, most of the album was already recorded even over three months before the commercial release of Nebraska. In May 1983, Springsteen cut another song, ""My Hometown"" at The Hit Factory and around the end of the year he taped the two final tracks originally considered for the album – ""No Surrender"" and ""Bobby Jean"".\n\nA last moment addition was ""Dancing in the Dark"", a song specifically commissioned by Springsteen\'s producer and manager Jon Landau, who was satisfied with the material recorded but wanted a blockbuster first single, one that was fresh and directly relevant to Springsteen\'s current state of mind. Landau and Springsteen got into an argument, but later on Springsteen wrote ""Dancing in the Dark"" with some trepidation. His irked mood from the day\'s argument combined with the frustrations at trying to complete the album quickly poured out into the lyrics. As he wrote on his 1998 book Songs, ""It went as far in the direction of pop music as I wanted to go – and probably a little farther."" However, Springsteen noted that ""My heroes, from Hank Williams to Frank Sinatra to Bob Dylan, were popular musicians. They had hits. There was value in trying to connect with a large audience.""\n\nOne of the songs that was about to be left-off the album was No Surrender. Springsteen claimed that this was because ""you don’t hold out and triumph all the time in life. You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life’s gray areas."" Steven Van Zandt, convinced Springsteen otherwise: ""He argued that the portrait of friendship and the song’s expression of the inspirational power of rock music was an important part of the picture.""\n\n""Dancing in the Dark"" was chosen as the first single for the album and it was released on May 4, 1984. The song surprised both critics and the public, as it showed the E Street Band using synthesizer for the first time. The track was enthusiastically received by both critics and the public, particularly pointing at Springsteen\'s change of sound on the wake of the blockbuster success of Michael Jackson\'s Thriller and the popularity of pop music in general in America. The song quickly climbed the charts, and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached #1 on the Cashbox singles charts for two weeks on June 30. ""Dancing in the Dark"" also provided Springsteen a Top 10 hit in several countries and the most successful single of his career. The album itself reached #1 on the Billboard 200 one week later, on July 7, spending the following three weeks also at the top. It came back to the #1 position on January 19, 1985 for three further weeks.\n\nIn late July, the next single, ""Cover Me"", was released, and reached at #7 on October. Then, the title track, a stinging tale of the hardships suffered by returning Vietnam veterans, was released immediately, eventually becoming one of Springsteen\'s best known songs, accumulating a considerable amount of folklore. The song\'s anthemic feel (and the music video, which featured scenes of waving flags and pastoral American communities reminiscent of a political campaign ad) led to widespread misinterpretation of the track\'s meaning. Springsteen was praised by US President Ronald Reagan as a great patriot. It was another Top 10 hit, reaching #9 in January 1985. Shortly, the follow-up, ""I\'m on Fire"", released in February, was also a big hit, reaching #6 in May. The next month, ""Glory Days"" was also released, reaching #5 in August supported also with a music video. The last two singles, ""I\'m Goin\' Down"" and ""My Hometown"", released in September and November 1985 almost equaled the success of their predecessors, and even with no music videos and less airplay, they managed to reach #9 and #6.\n\nOverall, then, Columbia released a total of seven singles for the album in the United States, a particularly strange feat for a rock album, especially coming from Springsteen, who was seen at the time essentially as an ""albums artist"". (There was some controversy surrounding the release of its latest singles, with Cliff Bernstein, as manager of Def Leppard and Dokken, considered that ""a sixth single is a little bit of overkill."") Thanks to these singles, Springsteen was an almost constant presence on the Billboard Hot 100 between May 1984 and March 1986. All seven received extensive promotion, enjoyed respectable sales and gained considerable airplay, and four of them were supported with music videos. With this strong support, the album achieved a record-tying string of seven Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot 100 by an album (equaling the record achieved by Michael Jackson\'s Thriller (1982) and later also equaled by Janet Jackson\'s Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989). The constant presence of Springsteen in the music industry represented an invaluable support for the album, which enjoyed an impressive staying power on the charts, spending its 84 first weeks at the Top 10 (which included the whole calendar year of 1985) and a total of 139 weeks on the entire list. Despite being released as early as June 1984, it was the best-selling album of 1985 in the United States.\n\nIn terms of sales, Born in the U.S.A.\'s were enourmous. In the U.S., on July 8, 1984, just one month after its release, it received a Platinum certification by the RIAA. Further certifications were awarded throughout the following year, and on November 1, 1985 (when the final single wasn\'t still even released and the album was still on the Top 10) it was certified Diamond (recognizing ten million copies sold only in America). It eventually reached a 15xPlatinum certification on April 19, 1995. In all, Born in the U.S.A. sold 15 million copies in the United States and at least other 10 million internationally. It still stands as the best-selling rock album by a solo artist.\n\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. was also notable for its production of music videos. In the wake of the success of Michael Jackson\'s Thriller, supported with creative, polished and high-budget music videos, Springsteen adopted the format for the first time in 1984 and recorded promotional videos for four out of the seven singles of Born in the U.S.A.. This videos were decisive for introducing Springsteen\'s music to a new, younger, and wider audience, as they received heavy rotation and support by the recently-launched MTV.\n\nThe video for ""Dancing in the Dark"" was directed by Brian DePalma. Set at a live performance, it\'s perhaps best remembered for the appearance of Courteney Cox as a fan who is invited on stage by Springsteen, and dances with him. (The video played a large role in launching Cox\'s career, which reached its heights when becoming one of the stars of NBC\'s sitcom Friends.) The video was filmed in June 1984 at the St. Paul Civic Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, before and during the initial show of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour and first aired on July 10, 1984 on MTV. The next video for the album was the one made for the title track. It was directed by noted filmmaker John Sayles and also consisted of video concert footage of Springsteen and the E Street Band performing the song, poorly synchronized with audio from the studio recording. Released in mid-December 1984, there supposedly had not been enough time to mix the audio from the concert. This footage was intermixed with compelling mid-1980s scenes of working-class America, emphasizing images that had some connection with the song, including Vietnam veterans, Amerasian children, assembly lines, oil refineries, cemeteries, and the like, finishing with a grizzled Springsteen posing in front of an American flag.\n\nThe other two videos for the album were more ambitious productions, as portrayed storylines that alluded to the emotions of the songs. The video for ""I\'m on Fire"", shot in March 1985 in Los Angeles, and also directed by Sayles, featured Springsteen as a working class automobile mechanic and an attractive, married, very well-to-do, mostly unseen female customer who brings her vintage Ford Thunderbird in for frequent servicing, always requesting that he does the work. She gives him all her keys, not just the ones for the car. Later that night, he drives the T-Bird up to her mansion high in the hills above the city. He is about to ring the bell, when he thinks better of it, smiles wistfully, drops her keys in the mailbox next to the door and walks away down towards the lights below. It was the first video showing Springsteen\'s actoral side, it began airing in mid-April 1985 and, later in the year won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video.\n\nThe final video for the album was the one shot for ""Glory Days"". It was shot in late May 1985 in various locations in New Jersey, and also directed by Sailes. It featured a narrative story of Springsteen, playing the protagonist in the song, talking to his young son and pitching to a wooden backstop against an imaginary lineup (he eventually lost the game to Graig Nettles). Intercut with these were scenes of Springsteen and the E Street Band lip-synching the song in a bar. Although he had left the band more than two years earlier, Steven Van Zandt was invited back to perform in this video, along with his sometimes hysterical stage antics but the two new members of the band, Nils Lofgren and Patti Scialfa, who had not been on the record at all, were also featured. Springsteen\'s then-wife Julianne Phillips made a cameo appearance at the baseball field at the end. The video began airing on MTV in mid-June 1985.\n\nIn an effort (a first for Springsteen) to gain dance and club play for his music, and more non-whites in his audience, remixes for the first singles from the album were executed by maestro Arthur Baker. He first created the 12-inch ""Blaster Mix"" of ""Dancing in the Dark"", wherein he completely reworked the album version. Overdubbed were tom-toms, dulcimers, glockenspiel, assorted backing vocals, bass and horn sythesizer parts, and gunshot sounds. Springsteen\'s vocal part was chopped up, double-tracked, echoed and repeated, with certain lines such as ""You sit around getting older"" and ""Heeey, baby!"" made even more prominent. The remix was released on July 2, 1984 and generated a lot of media buzz for Springsteen, as well as actual club play. It went to #7 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, and had the most sales of any 12-inch single in the United States in 1984. However, many of Springsteen\'s hard-core rock fans, who had been suspicious of the new sound of ""Dancing in the Dark"" to begin with, despised the remix. Baker was subsequently quoted in angry response: ""I got really offended. What is so different? It has a fucking glockenspiel, which Bruce has used before, background vocals ... it\'s no different. See, if any of those mixes had come out before, with no one knowing the other version, no one would have said a word.""\n\nBaker created the 12-inch ""Undercover Mix"" of ""Cover Me"" next, making a large-scale transformation: a new bass line was cut, an unused backing vocal by industry legend Jocelyn Brown was restored, and reggae and dub elements were introduced. Released on October 15, 1984, it also found displeasing from many fans, but managed to reached #11 on the Dance charts. Finally, on January 10, 1985, it was released the 12-inch ""Freedom Mix"" of ""Born in the U.S.A."". It was a fairly radical remixing, even more so than those Baker had done for the album\'s previous singles. The mix removed any (possibly misleading) anthemic elements and pushed the song\'s mournfulness to the front. Synthesizer, glockenspiel, and drums were chopped up and isolated against Springsteen vocal fragments saying ""Oh my God, no,"" and ""U.S.A.—U.S.—U.S.—U.S.A."" This remix was the least commercially successful of Baker\'s efforts, however, as unlike the prior two it failed to appear on Billboard\'s Dance chart.\n\nAs of 1984, was an American megastar for almost a decade. However, as Larry Rodgers interpreted it, ""it was not until hit the gym to get buffed up and showed off his rear end in Annie Leibovitz’s famous cover photo for Born in the U.S.A. that he became an American pop icon"" , touching off a wave of Bossmania (as author Chris Smith described it ).\n\nFor the album, Springsteen reintroduced himself as a muscular and sexually-charged rocker after his addoption of constant wearing of tight blue jeans, white t-shirts and bandanas, and also an intensive physical training that included years of running, weightlifting and bodybuilding.\n\nAccording to Bryan K. Garman, in his book A Race of Singers – Whitman\'s Working-Class Hero From Guthrie to Springsteen"", these new image helped Springsteen to popularize his image on a new scale, but also brought him a decisive attachement to political and sociocultural issues, in the times when Ronald Reagan was reviving a patriotic pride by reaffirming the values of prosperity, expansion, and world domination of the United States ""within a decidedly masculine framework"". \n\nFor Garman, as Reagan\'s combination of masculinity and nationalism shaped a popular culture that ""remasculinized"" the country\'s image of, Americans found themselves reading and watching about the Vietnam War, trying to come to terms with the lost war and the soldiers who fought it. At the time, the huge popularity of Sylvester Stallone\'s ""Rambo"" films demonstrated both the public\'s fascination with the Vietnam veteran and the symbiotic relationship that existed between the Reagan presidency and much of the popular culture of its era. According to the author, Springsteen found himself enmeshed in the ideologies and symbols that Rambo and Reagan represented. In August 1985, the Chicago Tribune, coining a slogan that would soon appear on novelty T-shirts and bumper stickers throughout the country, declared him the Rambo of rock and roll, and a national hero who, like Stallone\'s character, ""only wants America to love him as much as he loves it."" According to this editorial, Springsteen reprised ""the defiant, good ol\' boy, blue-collar skepticism of Merle Haggard"".\n\nAt the time, it was a common thought that both Rambo and Springsteen shared the same politics. As Garman puts it, ""Stallone and springsteen addressed questions of national identity, confronted the legacy of Vietnam, and, in some ways, physically resembled each other: they both had dark shoulder-length hair, wore bandanas as part of their costumes, and flaunted their muscular physiques. To be sure, the heroic and sexualized image that Springsteen cultivated was an important component of his popularity and in large part accounted for his appropiation by the Right."" He also mentions that Springsteen began also to be characterized by a kind of stage performance that ""(on one level) liberates his fans by presenting the possibility of sexual freedom. On another, it reaffirms the power of masculinity."" Garman concluded his analysis with the sentence: ""Like Reagan and Rambo, the apparently working-class Springsteen was for many American a white hard-bodied hero whose masculinity confirmed the values of patriarchy and patriotism, the work ethic and rugged individualism, and who clearly demarcated the boundaries between men and women, black and white, heterosexual and homosexual."" \n\nThroughout time, the album did not lose its cultural and social relevance and was re-introduced to succesive generations. As an example, even two decades after its original release, Rolling Stone published a celebrated cover showing Simpons\'s character Homer Simpson in a re-make of the cover of the album. Springsteen himself noted on his 1998 book Songs: ""“For years after the release of the album, at Halloween, I had little kids in red bandanas knocking on at my door... singing, I was born in the U.S.A. They were not particularly well-versed in the Had a brother at Khe Sahn lyric.”\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. was received by music critics with mostly unniversal acclaim and praise. However, some argued its evident commercial edge and synthesized production, especially when compared to the obscure, introspective predecessor, the critical favourite Nebraska. That wasn\'t a problem for respected authors as Robert Christgau, who, at the time of release, gave an A+ to the album, recognizing it as his ""most rhythmically propulsive, vocally incisive, lyrically balanced, and commercially undeniable album."" He added that ""the aural vibrancy of the thing reminds me like nothing in years that what teenagers loved about rock and roll wasn\'t that it was catchy or even vibrant but that it just plain sounded good."" He finally stated that, ""while Nebraska\'s one-note vision may be more left-correct, my instincts (not to mention my leftism) tell me that this uptempo worldview is truer."" Rolling Stone also praised the album, giving it five out of five stars, highlighting the prevalecence of umptempo songs, and calling it an album of ""rowdy, indomitable spirit""  AllMusic also gave five stars to the album, with William Ruhlmann considering that it was the apotheosis of the E Street Band and a culmination of a road traced since their very beginning – ""the place where they renewed their commitment and where Springsteen remembered that he was a rock & roll star, which is how a vastly increased public was happy to treat him."" \n\nIn June 2009, the album confirmed its enduring popularity as many critics and journalists revisited the album with particularly enthusiasm as its theme coincided with the ""new hope"" bought in the wake of the Obama era. However, in July, author Charles A. Hohman spread controversy when criticized the album on Pop Matters for ""stressing male sexuality as imperative to the American Dream"" and leaving women out of the picture or, in any case, on a dominated position. According to him. ""from the hypermasculine stance on the cover to Springsteen\'s forcefully vigorous vocals throughout, Born in the U.S.A. is an album about masculinity, clearly operating from a man\'s point of view. To Springsteen\'s credit, his women are seldom sex objects, and when they are, such as on ""Darlington County"", that objectification is punished. However, there is little subversion of assigned gender roles within Springsteen’s portraits. In fact, his women are largely powerless, kept firmly in the private sphere, functioning as trophies or even as entitlements for the male protagonists."" Hohman also pointed that on the album, ""just as women can protect from the storms raging in the cutthroat, rough-and-tumble working world, they can be the storm as well. The pursuit of women, like the pursuit of money and prosperity, can lead to danger, corruption, even punishment. And so after championing the safeguarding contentment that women can provide once attained, Born launches into two hard-luck delinquent tales, tragicomic and almost cinematic narratives of men chasing women as one more essential piece to their ideal American life. ""Darlington County"" and ""Working on the Highway"" are Born\'s most linear, and arguably most obscure, compositions, but both illustrate the troubles that can trap men in search of female companionship."" \n\nBorn in the U.S.A. was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice\'s Pazz & Jop critics poll. In 2003, the album was ranked number 85 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 1989, it was rated #6 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. Chris Smith also included the album in his book 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music, stating that it was, lyrically, ""as desperate as Nebraska, but the energy of the E Street Band brought the songs such power that many mistook the album–and the title track in particular– as a celebration of patriotism devoid of any critical commentary.""\n\nDespite the blockbuster success and critical acclaim of the album, Springsteen often expressed some mixed feelings about it. He often considered that Nebraska contains some of his strongest writing, while Born in the U.S.A. didn\'t necessarily follow suit. The title track, ""more or less stood by itself,” he declared. ""The rest of the album contains a group of songs about which I’ve always had some ambivalence."" Even so, and despite calling it the ""grab-bag nature"" of the album, he acknowledged its powerful effect on his career, claiming: ""Born in the U.S.A. changed my life and gave me my largest audience. It forced me to question the way I presented my music and made me think harder about what I was doing.""\n\nThe title track inspired the celebrated Annie Leibowitz photo of Springsteen\'s butt against the backdrop of an American flag. Bruce had to be convinced to use it as the album\'s cover. Some people thought it depicted Springsteen urinating on the flag.\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. became the first compact disc manufactured in the United States for commercial release, when CBS Records opened its CD manufacturing plant in Terre Haute, Indiana in September 1984. Discs previously had been imported from Japan.\n\nIn 2004, Senator John Kerry used ""No Surrender"" as his campaign theme song during his 2004 presidential campaign. Springsteen performed the song at several Kerry rallies during the campaign.\n\nAs on Billboard, all seven Born in the U.S.A.\'s singles reached the Top 10 on the Cashbox singles chart. They reached #1 (""Dancing in the Dark""), #7 (""My Hometown""), #8 (""I\'m on Fire""), #9 (""Born in the U.S.A."", ""Glory Days"" and ""I\'m Goin\' Down"") and #10 (""Cover Me""). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/Born+in+the+U.S.A."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After testing the limits of how musically and thematically challenging rock could be on Velvet Underground & Nico and White Light/White Heat, this 1969 release sounded spare, quiet, and contemplative, as if the previous albums documented some manic, speed-fueled party and this was the subdued morning after. (The album\'s relative calm has often been attributed to the departure of the band\'s most committed avant-gardist, John Cale, in the fall of 1968; the arrival of new bassist Doug Yule; and the theft of the band\'s amplifiers shortly before they began recording.) But Lou Reed\'s lyrical exploration of the demimonde is as keen here as on any album he ever made, while displaying a warmth and compassion he sometimes denied his characters. ""Candy Says,"" ""Pale Blue Eyes,"" and ""I\'m Set Free"" may be more muted in approach than what the band had done in the past, but ""What Goes On"" and ""Beginning to See the Light"" made it clear the VU still loved rock & roll, and ""The Murder Mystery"" (which mixes and matches four separate poetic narratives) is as brave and uncompromising as anything on White Light/White Heat. This album sounds less like the Velvet Underground than any of their studio albums, but it\'s as personal, honest, and moving as anything Lou Reed ever committed to tape. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/The+Velvet+Underground"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This prompted the band to make Physical Graffiti a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions.\n\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful; the album is 16 times platinum (though this only signifies sales of 8 million copies, as it is a double album) in the United States alone, and has come to be regarded as one of Led Zeppelin\'s defining works. In 2003, the album was ranked number 70 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album was released on 24 February 1975, at a time when Led Zeppelin was undertaking its tenth concert tour of North America. Delays in the production of the album\'s sleeve design prevented its release prior to the commencement of the tour.\n\nPhysical Graffiti was the band\'s first release on their own Swan Song Records label, which had been launched in May 1974. Until this point, all of Led Zeppelin\'s albums had been released on Atlantic Records. The album was a commercial and critical success, having built up a huge advance order, and when eventually released it reached #1 on Billboard\'s Pop Albums chart. It has since proven to be one of the most popular releases by the group, selling 8 million copies in the United States alone (which has made it 16 times platinum as it is a double album). Physical Graffiti was the first album to go platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart.\n\nBillboard magazine\'s 5 star review of the album stated: "" is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to folky acoustic to orchestral sounds."" In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Physical Graffiti the 28th greatest album of all time; in 2000 Q placed it at number 32 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever; and in 2001 the same magazine named it as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. In 2003 the TV network VH1 named it the 71st greatest album ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 70 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album is also listed in Robert Dimery and Stevie Chick\'s 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Physical+Graffiti"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing Eminem\'s entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem\'s lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""The Way I Am"", ""Stan"", ""I\'m Back"" and ""Bitch Please II"". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem\'s best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while ""The Real Slim Shady"" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album\'s sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album\'s lead single ""My Name Is"" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann ""Kim"" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song ""\'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, ""I don\'t trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don\'t know if they are hanging with me \'cause they like me or because I\'m a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as ""misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence"", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of ""making money by exploiting the world\'s misery"".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The ""free"" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long ""creative binge"", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to ""map out"" each song. He described himself as a ""studio rat"" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, ""We don\'t wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, \'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.\' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from ""fucking around"" in the studio; ""Marshall Mathers"" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while ""Criminal"" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. ""Kill You"" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n""Kim"" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote ""Kim"" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, ""I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, \'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this\'. The song ""Stan"" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem\'s manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer\'s beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido\'s ""Thank You"". Upon hearing the song\'s lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for ""Stan"" differed greatly from Eminem\'s usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: ""\'Stan\' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard ""Stan"" and enjoyed it, and observed, ""I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, \'We like your album, we\'ve used this track. Hope you don\'t mind, and hope you like it.\' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, \'Wow! This track\'s amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album\'s first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, ""I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote ""The Way I Am"" as his way of saying, ""Look, this is the best I can do. I can\'t give you another \'My Name Is.\' I can\'t just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became ""The Real Slim Shady"". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, ""It was funny to me. As long as it\'s hot, let\'s roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let\'s have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album\'s first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem\'s vocals. The background music on the record employs ""liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes"". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of ""Marshall Mathers"" to the atmosphere of ""Amityville"". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido\'s song ""Thank You"" for ""Stan"", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem\'s major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album\'s lyrics "" the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary"". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to ""dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, ""Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there\'s a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem\'s childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother (""Kill You""), the relationship struggles with his wife (""Kim""), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations (""Stan"", ""I\'m Back"", and ""Marshall Mathers""), his return and effect on the music industry (""Remember Me?"", ""Bitch Please II""), his drug use (""Drug Ballad"", ""The Kids""), his effect on the American youth and society (""The Way I Am"", ""Who Knew""), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes (""Criminal""). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem\'s verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song ""Criminal"" features the line ""My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That\'ll stab you in the head whether you\'re a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer\'s yes"". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for ""encourag violence against gay men and lesbians"". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, ""If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he\'s to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears\' invitation to \'hit me baby, one more time\'. Eminem noted that he began using the word ""faggot"" more frequently when ""people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse"", but added, ""I think it\'s hard for some people to understand that for me the word \'faggot\' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, ""Kill You"", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper\'s first album, nightmares of ""ladies\' screams"", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and ""notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers\'. The six-and-a-half minute long ""Stan"" samples Dido\'s ""Thank You"" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On ""Who Knew"", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem\'s response ranges oscillates from ""smart-ass (\'Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin\' eyeballs out and turn \'em around?\') to smart (\'Ain\'t they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught \'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?\').""Who Knew"" is followed by the ""Steve Berman"" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about ""big-screen TVs, blunts, 40\'s, and bitches"", while Eminem raps about ""homosexuals and Vicodin"", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n""The Way I Am"" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being ""pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock \'n\' roll stations"". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. ""The Real Slim Shady"" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. ""Remember Me?"" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who ""kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track"". In the song, he states ""I\'m tryna clean up my fuckin\' image / So I promised the fuckin\' critics / I wouldn\'t say \'fuckin\' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you\'re on)"". Despite saying the word ""fuck"" one more time in ""Remember Me"", and three times at the beginning of ""I\'m Back"", he does not say the word ""fuckin"" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song ""Marshall Mathers"".\n""I\'m Back"" features Eminem\'s observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he ""became a commodity/\'Cause I\'m W-H-I-T-E"". The next song, ""Marshall Mathers"", mocks the chorus of LFO\'s ""Summer Girls"", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. ""Drug Ballad"" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper\'s struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him ""sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I\'m in love with you"". ""Amityville"" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city\'s crowning as murder capital of the United States. ""Bitch Please II"" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n""Kim"", the prequel to ""97 Bonnie and Clyde"" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem ""screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew"". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, ""Bleed, bitch, bleed!"" ""Kim"" is followed by ""Under the Influence"", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 ""runs rampant"" on the track. ""Criminal"" features production from F.B.T., which consists of ""piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that \'you can\'t stop me from topping these charts...\'\'. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that ""half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad"".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, ""I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, \'I\'ve made it\', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem\'s appearance on the cover to a ""dysfunctional Little Rascal"", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper\'s musical evolution: ""Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP ""resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like ""ass"", ""bitch"", ""goddamn"", and ""shit"" were uncensored. However, on the track ""The Real Slim Shady"", the words ""bitch"" and ""shit"" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs ""Kill You"", ""Drug Ballad"" and ""Bitch Please II"" are written as ""**** You"", ""Ballad"" and ""***** Please II"" on the back cover of the album. The song ""Kim"" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed ""The Kids"".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words ""kids"" and ""Columbine"" from the line, ""I take seven  from , stand them all in line"" from ""I\'m Back"", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a ""curious decision, given that lyrics like \'Take drugs / Rape sluts\' are apparently permissible"". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, ""That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin\' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I\'ve been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem\'s song ""Rap God"" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line ""It doesn\'t matter  faggot"" was also censored from ""Marshall Mathers"", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson\'s lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg\'s 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album\'s first single, ""The Real Slim Shady"", became Eminem\'s biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. ""The Way I Am"", which was released as the album\'s second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. ""Stan"", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem\'s best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine\'s Touré applauded Dr. Dre\'s production and Eminem\'s varied lyrical style on what is a ""car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling"", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem\'s startlingly intense vision of ""rap\'s self-consciousness"" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and ""gruelling assault course of lyrical genius"" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper\'s consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him ""exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit"", while declaring the album ""a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that\'s both personal and political"". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is ""indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable"".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was ""mixed"", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem\'s ""verbal skills and transgressive humor"" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, ""docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem\'s ""vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults"" would ""almost grow tedious if he weren\'t as inventive as he is tasteless."" Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem\'s disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine\'s Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: ""The only thing worse than Eminem\'s homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it"". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan\'s Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem\'s best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it ""delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre."" According to Sputnikmusic\'s Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also ""remains a truly special album, unique in rap\'s canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I\'ve rarely heard"". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, ""At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem\'s albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, ""The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that ""Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains ""one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history"", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as ""a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album\'s impact on white rappers, saying, ""For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine\'s revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\'s list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. Popdose listed The Marshall Mathers LP as the 10th best album of the decade. Spinner ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of ""The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers"". In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by About.com on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, The Marshall Mathers LP was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of Stacker, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for ""promot violence of the most degrading kind against women"", labeling him as ""a rap singer who advocates murder and rape"". She specifically cited lyrics from ""Kill You"", explaining, ""He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.\'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry"". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States\' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has ""long been a vocal supporter of free speech"", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto\'s SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. ""I personally don\'t want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women"", he said. Flaherty claims to have been ""disgusted"" when reading transcriptions of Eminem\'s song ""Kill You"", which includes lines like ""Slut, you think I won\'t choke no whore/till the vocal cords don\'t work in her throat no more? Eminem\'s fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada\'s hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada\'s hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, ""Being offensive is Eminem\'s job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem\'s music and that the rapper ""authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to ""I\'m Back"" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album\'s content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed ""Stan"" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, ""Of course I\'d heard of Elton John, but I didn\'t know he was gay. I didn\'t know anything about his personal life. I didn\'t really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John\'s decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, ""Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear \'em argue over who she gave head to first"" from ""The Real Slim Shady"", calling the rapper\'s claim ""disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true"". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper\'s secret marriage to Kim Mathers.

It was released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings.\n\nAfter releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording his debut album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. Other producers to work on the album included Om\'Mas Keith and Pharrell Williams. Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator, vocalist/songwriter André 3000, and guitarist John Mayer.\n\nChannel Orange has an unconventional musical style, drawing on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, psychedelic music, and nonmusical sounds such as film dialogue and ambient noise that function as interludes. Vocally, Ocean uses a free-form flow as well as alternating falsetto and tenor registers throughout the album. His songwriting explores themes of unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme–color synesthesia, through which he perceived the color orange during the summer he first fell in love.\n\nTo prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean and Def Jam released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. It was promoted with five singles, including Ocean\'s highest charting single ""Thinkin Bout You"" (number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100) and a supporting concert tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week, eventually selling 621,000 copies in the US by September 2014. Critically, it was the best-reviewed album of 2012 and the year\'s top-ranked album in numerous critics\' lists, including the American Pazz & Jop and the British HMV Poll of Polls. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Channel Orange was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Urban Contemporary Album. It has been featured in several lists of the best albums of the 2010s and of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/channel+ORANGE"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is considered by some to be one of the greatest albums in pop music history, and won several awards including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989. The album was an instant commercial success in the United States, selling more than 1 million copies in its debut, the most copies ever sold in a week by a British pop artist. To date, the album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and received diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Faith spawned six top 5 singles that substantially helped it dominate the chart of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAfter the split of Wham!, Michael spent the most part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for his breakthrough project. In addition to playing a large number of instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, ""Look at Your Hands"", which he co-wrote with David Austin. Using the then-revolutionary Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio, Faith was Michael\'s first digital recording. A contemporary R&B album, Faith showcases the vocals of Michael in a new-style mode. It features songs littered with introspective lyrics, generating controversies about Michael\'s personal relationships at that time.\n\nThe public speculated that 1988 was the year of George Michael. The success of the album put him in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of 1988. Others also said that George Michael might be the successor of Elton John.\n\nThe album earned George Michael numerous accolades. At the 31st Grammy Awards, he was nominated for the Album of the Year and won. George Michael racked up three wins at the 1989 American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Album for Faith.\n\nThe album became a massive success commercially. Between 1987 and 1988, Faith produced an amazing string of hit singles, including six Top 5 Billboard Hot 100 hits, four of which (""Faith"", ""Father Figure"", ""One More Try"", and ""Monkey"") reached #1, making him the only British male singer to have four #1 singles from one LP on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also had impressive staying power, with 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the Billboard 200 Top 10, including 12 weeks at #1. It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit #1 on the US R&B charts. It also reached #1 in the United Kingdom, where it stayed at the top spot for only one week. In all, it was the best-selling album of 1988 in the United States, and eventually reached Diamond certification by the RIAA. According to Nielsen/SoundScan, current sales stand at 11 million copies, making it the 52nd best-selling album in the United States.\n\nThe album peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming Michael\'s first number-one solo album. Its early, and successive, success on the chart was said to be partly sustained—with help from plenty of press appearances and promotions—by its strong single releases. With ""I Want Your Sex"" propelling the album\'s debut atop the chart, ""Faith"", the second single off the album facilitated the album\'s continuing dominance as well. ""Faith"" was 1988\'s best-selling single in the United States; with ""Careless Whisper"" being the best-selling single in 1985, it honoured George Michael for being the first act to achieve two U.S. year-end #1 singles since 1968, when The Beatles had ""Hey Jude"" top the year-end singles chart after ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in 1964.\n\nThe album continued its dominance on the chart of 1988. The self-titled debut album by Tiffany ended its first week run at the top spot; however, Faith reclaimed the position the following week for five consecutive weeks. Over nine months after its release, Faith was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for 5 million U.S. shipments. To date, the album has sold twenty million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 1989, Faith was ranked #84 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Faith was ranked 79th in a 2005 survey held by British television\'s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n\nWith sales of more than seven million in 1988, Faith was named in the United States as the most shipped album of the year. Along with the success of the American singer Michael Jackson\'s album Bad, as well as breakthrough albums by many new and old artists, it was seen as a sign that US record sales were slowly recovering. By the end of 1988, the industry had sold millions of albums, an increase of approximately one percent, as recorded by Nielsen SoundScan. Compared with record sales in 1987, this showed two percent of increase. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael/Faith"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after one of his works.\n\nSynchronicity topped both the Billboard Pop Albums and Billboard 200 charts (ending the reign of Michael Jackson\'s Thriller for a while in the US). It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nIn 2001, the TV network VH1 named Synchronicity the 50th greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 455 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album marked a significant reduction in the reggae influences that were a part of the band\'s first four records, instead featuring production-heavy textures and liberal use of synthesizers that, at times, drove entire songs (""Synchronicity I"", ""Wrapped Around Your Finger""). The influence of World music can also be heard in songs such as ""Tea in the Sahara"" and ""Walking in Your Footsteps"". Sting\'s material dominates the album, with the two short tracks by Andy Summers (""Mother"") and Stewart Copeland (""Miss Gradenko"") being seen by the band themselves as concessions.\n\nAs with their prior album, the basic tracks for Synchronicity were recorded at AIR Studios, Montserrat. For sound engineering reasons, the three band members recorded their parts in separate rooms: Copeland with his drums in the dining room, Sting in the control room, and Summers in the actual studio. This physical separation underscored the increasing tension and strain in the relationship between the bandmates. According to co-producer Hugh Padgham, subsequent overdubs were actually done with only one member in the studio at a time due to such strain.\n\n""Synchronicity I"" starts the album off with a sequencer line that repeats throughout the song. ""Walking in Your Footsteps"" features lyrics concerning the relation between extinct dinosaurs and nuclear weapon equipped humans, and is followed by the jazziest song on the album, ""O My God"". (The song is actually a reworked version of the early Police song ""Three O\'Clock Shot"" which was never recorded on an album but was widely bootlegged from live performances.) ""Mother"" features strange, Indian-like sounds and screamed vocals by Andy Summers, and ""Miss Gradenko"" is a two-minute song about a woman in the middle of the Soviet bureaucracy. ""Synchronicity II"" features extensive use of audio feedback, and is the heaviest song on the record.\n\n""Every Breath You Take"", which begins side two of the record is possibly The Police\'s best-known song, with Sting\'s vocals on top of a steady rhythm featuring picked guitar, strong bass, and controlled drumming. Originally, the song was what Andy Summers called a ""Hammond organ thing that sounded like Billy Preston."" The guitarist came up with a more interesting guitar riff which became distinctive part of the piece. The song, released before the album, went to #1 on both the U.S. and UK charts, aided by a black and white video directed by Godley & Creme.\n\n""King of Pain"" features a lyrical imagery and numerous effects and instruments, while ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" uses subdued keyboards. The record\'s closer, ""Tea in the Sahara"", is a quiet, eerie song about three women who are deceived by a prince and left in the desert, where they meet their death. The title of this song comes from a section of Paul Bowles\' novel The Sheltering Sky, which mentions the story. ""Murder By Numbers"", originally the B-side of ""Every Breath You Take"", was added to the CD and cassette versions of the album, and has lyrics detailing the development of a serial killer. ""Synchronicity I"" and ""Synchronicity II"" allude to The Second Coming, a poem by William Butler Yeats.\n\n""King of Pain"" and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" also made it into the Top Ten, and ""Synchronicity II"" reached the Top Twenty.

The ideal blend of mythmaking and gritty reality, At Folsom Prison is the moment when Cash turned into the towering Man in Black, a haunted troubadour singing songs of crime, conflicted conscience, and jail. Surely, this dark outlaw stance wasn\'t a contrivance but it was an exaggeration, with Cash creating this image by tailoring his set list to his audience of prisoners, filling up the set with tales of murder and imprisonment -- a bid for common ground with the convicts, but also a sly way to suggest that maybe Cash really did shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die. Given the cloud of death that hangs over the songs on At Folsom Prison, there\'s a temptation to think of it as a gothic, gloomy affair or perhaps a repository of rage, but what\'s striking about Cash\'s performance is that he never romanticizes either the crime or the criminals: if anything, he underplays the seriousness with his matter-of-fact ballad delivery or how he throws out wry jokes. Cash is relating to the prisoners and he\'s entertaining them too, singing ""Cocaine Blues"" like a bastard on the run, turning a death sentence into literal gallows humor on ""25 Minutes to Go,"" playing ""I Got Stripes"" as if it were a badge of pride. Never before had his music seemed so vigorous as it does here, nor had he tied together his humor, gravity, and spirituality in one record. In every sense, it was a breakthrough, but more than that, At Folsom Prison is the quintessential Johnny Cash album, the place where his legend burns bright and eternal.\n(The Expanded Edition CD of At Folsom Prison added three bonus tracks to the songs included in the original 16-track LP.)\n- AMG review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine -\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/At+Folsom+Prison"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is considered a key release in the revival of underground guitar rock and the transition from post-punk and new wave to alternative rock.\n\nMurmur is the debut album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M., released in 1983 on I.R.S. Records. Murmur drew critical acclaim upon its release for its sound, defined by singer Michael Stipe\'s cryptic lyrics, guitarist Peter Buck\'s jangly guitar style, and bassist Mike Mills\' melodic basslines.\n\nR.E.M. started recording its debut album in December 1982. I.R.S. paired R.E.M. with producer Stephen Hague, who had a higher profile than the band\'s previous producer Mitch Easter. Hague\'s emphasis on technical perfection did not suit the band; the producer made the group perform multiple takes of the song ""Catapult"", which demoralized drummer Bill Berry. Also, Hague took the completed track to Synchro Sound studios in Boston and added keyboard parts to the track without the band\'s permission and to their dismay.\nUnsatisfied, the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter.  I.R.S. agreed to a ""tryout"" session, allowing the band to travel to North Carolina and record the song ""Pilgrimage"" with Easter and producing partner Don Dixon. After hearing the track, I.R.S. permitted the group to record the album with Dixon and Easter. R.E.M. entered Reflection Studios in Charlotte, North Carolina in January 1983 to begin recording sessions with Easter and Dixon. Much of the band\'s material for the album had been tested on preceding tours. Because of its bad experience with Hague, the band recorded the album via a process of negation, refusing to incorporate rock music clichés such as guitar solos or then-popular synthesizers, in order to give its music a timeless feel.  Berry in particular was resistant to ""odd"" musical suggestions, insisting that his drums be recorded in a drummer\'s booth, a practice that was antiquated at the time. Dixon and Easter took a hands-off approach to much of the recording process. The pair would only fix up a vocal track or ask singer Michael Stipe to re-record a vocal if it was very substandard. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Murmur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album features the two singles ""Strange Brew"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love"". By this time, the group was veering quite heavily away from their blues roots to indulge in more psychedelic sounds.\n\nThe title of the album was taken from an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, ""it\'s got them Disraeli Gears"", meaning to say ""derailleur gears,"" but instead alluding to 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick\'s turn of phrase, the album would simply have been entitled ""Cream.""\n\nClapton, Baker, and Jack Bruce all contributed songs with the help of lyricist Pete Brown and producer Felix Pappalardi. The track ""Blue Condition"" was unusual in that Baker, although not well known for his singing, took the lead vocal. The album was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York during May 1967, following the band\'s nine shows as part of Murray the K\'s ""Music in the 5th Dimension"" concert series. Cream\'s American label, ATCO, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic Records.\n\nThe psychedelic cover art was created by Australian artist Martin Sharp, who lived in the same building as Clapton at the time of the Chelsea artists colony The Pheasantry. At their first meeting in a London club, Clapton mentioned that he had some music that needed lyrics, so Sharp wrote out a poem he had composed on a napkin and gave it to Clapton, who recorded it as ""Tales of Brave Ulysses.""\n\nWhen interviewed on the episode of the VH1 show, Classic Albums, which featured Disraeli Gears, Bruce stated that when writing the song ""Take it Back"", he had been inspired by the contemporary media images of American students burning their draft cards and wrote the song in that spirit of rejecting militarism.\n\nIn 2004, the album was released as a 2-disc Deluxe edition including the complete album in both mono and stereo, demos, alternate takes and tracks taken from the band\'s live sessions on BBC radio. In 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time the same year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Disraeli+Gears"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in October 1988 by Enigma in the United States, and by Blast First in the United Kingdom. A number of publications, including Rolling Stone, Spin Magazine, and Pitchfork Media have hailed it as one of the best albums of the 1980s. As a result, it is regarded as a milestone of 1980s underground music.\n\nAlthough arguably the two albums immediately before it—Evol and Sister—mark Sonic Youth\'s first attempts at shifting from their roots in unsettling noise-rock to a somewhat more accessible combination of avant guitar experimentation and traditional rock, for many listeners, Daydream Nation is the apex where this change fully took hold. The album cover itself invokes this transition, with the 1983 Gerhard Richter photorealist painting Kerze (""Candle""). The back cover art is a similar Richter painting from 1982.\n\nNevertheless, initial sales were poor, partly because Enigma Records, Sonic Youth\'s American record label, went out of business not long after the record\'s release. After a period of being out of print, Daydream Nation was reissued by DGC in 1993, which had signed the band largely on the strength of the crossover critical acclaim reaped by the album. In 1988, the single ""Teen Age Riot"", charted on Billboard Magazine\'s newly created Modern Rock Tracks chart at #20.\n\nIn 2007, Sonic Youth undertook a series of performances of the album in its entirety.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, a two-CD deluxe edition of the album was released. It contains live versions of every track on the album, plus studio recordings of some cover songs. A 4-LP vinyl version was released on July 17, 2007.\n\nThis is Deluxe Edition and it should be called Daydream Nation (Deluxe Edition) , original release has only 12 tracks  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Daydream+Nation"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band recorded In Utero with Albini in two weeks in February 1993, capturing an abrasive and naturalistic sound for the record. While some of the songs had been written years prior, the lyrics largely dealt with frontman Kurt Cobain\'s reflections on his newfound fame and recent personal troubles, incorporating imagery of sickness and disease.\n\nSoon after recording was completed, controversy erupted as news reports stated that DGC did not like the band\'s sessions with Albini and refused to release the album, deeming it uncommercial. Nirvana denied the statements but were also not fully satisfied with the sound Albini captured. The band ultimately made some minor changes to the album\'s sound and hired producer Scott Litt to mix the singles ""Heart-Shaped Box"" and ""All Apologies"". Upon its release, In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over four million copies in the United States.\n\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting In Utero; the company\'s head of marketing told Billboard before the album\'s release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of Nevermind, and explained that the label would ""set things up, duck, and get out of the way"". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Utero\'s singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album\'s first single ""Heart-Shaped Box"" to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. Despite the label\'s promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, ""We\'re certain that we won\'t sell a quarter as much, and we\'re totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.""\n\nIn Utero was released on September 13, 1993 in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 in the United States; it was initially only available in vinyl record and cassette tape formats, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was issued on compact disc in the UK on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell the album. According to The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album ""didn\'t fit within our merchandise mix"". In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album\'s back cover. DGC issued a new version of the album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, and listed the name of ""Rape Me"" as ""Waif Me"". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they ""really want to make their music available to kids who don\'t have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores"".\n\nIn Utero received acclaim from critics. Time\'s Christopher John Farley stated in his review of the album, ""Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn\'t gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana."" Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote, ""In Utero is a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it\'s a triumph of the will."" Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne (who gave the album a rating of B+) commented ""Kurt Cobain hates it all"", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, ""The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke."" NME gave the album an eight out of ten rating. However, reviewer John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, ""As a document of a mind in flux — dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity — Kurt should be proud of . As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn\'t quite there."" Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album\'s more abrasive songs, ""In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly"", and added, ""Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with."" Critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics\' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nThat October, Nirvana embarked on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured ""All Apologies"" and ""Rape Me"", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg of the tour in February 1994, but it was cancelled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation, but the singer went missing soon afterwards, and on April 8 he was found dead in his Seattle home as the result of suicide by a shotgun blast. The intended third single from In Utero, ""Pennyroyal Tea"", was cancelled in the wake of Cobain\'s death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain\'s body was discovered, In Utero moved back up the Billboard charts, from number 72 to number 27.\n\nIn the ensuing years, In Utero has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 Guitar World article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album\'s release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that In Utero was ""a far better record  and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then In Utero is that lost pearl."" That same year, Pitchfork Media placed In Utero at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked it at number 439 on its list ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". In 2004 Blender ranked it at number 94 in its ""100 Greatest American Albums of All Time"" list, while in 2005, Spin placed it at number 51 on its ""100 Greatest Albums 1985-2005"" retrospective. In Utero has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over five million units, and has sold a total of four million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded during the golden age of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes of organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time.

Otis Blue was critically acclaimed upon release and became one of Redding’s most successful albums; it reached number 6 on the UK Albums Chart, and was his first to reach the top spot of the Billboard R&B chart. Furthermore, it produced three popular singles, all charting at least in the top 50 on both the Billboard R&B and the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is considered by many critics to be Redding’s first fully realized album.\n\nThree of the eleven songs were written by Redding: “Ole Man Trouble”, “Respect”, and “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long”. Three songs were written by Sam Cooke, a soul musician who had died a few months earlier. As was the case in the previous albums, Redding was backed by house band Booker T. & the M.G.’s, a horn section of members of The Mar-Keys and The Memphis Horns, and pianist Isaac Hayes.\n\nOtis Blue is included in a number of “best album” lists, including Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Time magazine’s list of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums, and Robert Dimery’s “1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die”.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Otis+Redding/Otis+Blue:+Otis+Redding+Sings+Soul"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded over 18 months between Los Angeles, New York, and Maraval, Trinidad, the sessions were interrupted by B.I.G.’s arrest for marijuana and gun possession, and a car accident that shattered his left leg, forcing him to stay seated for the majority of the album. The media frenzy surrounding the interpersonal rivalry between Biggie and California rapper Tupac Shakur also added increased pressure for the Brooklyn emcee to finish the album.\n\nThe landmark release spawned many hit singles, including “Mo\' Money, Mo\' Problems” and the platinum-selling “Hypnotize,” both of which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and were Grammy-nominated.\n\nPublic Enemy icon Chuck D somberly gave his observation on the tragic death of Christopher Wallace: ""With the shake-up behind the murders, beefs, and tensions between coasts, this album was a painful reminder of how talent that is snuffed out too soon, and over too little, was and is one of the number-one problems in the industry.

A certain amount of this reflects the angst of a group undergoing some severe internal strife, but Forever Changes is also an album that heralds the last days of a golden age and anticipates the growing ugliness that would dominate the counterculture in 1968 and 1969; images of violence and war haunt ""A House Is Not a Motel,"" the street scenes of ""Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hillsdale"" reflects a jaded mindset that flower power could not ease, the twin specters of race and international strife rise to the surface of ""The Red Telephone,"" romance becomes cynicism in ""Bummer in the Summer,"" the promise of the psychedelic experience decays into hard drug abuse in ""Live and Let Live,"" and even gentle numbers like ""Andmoreagain"" and ""Old Man"" sound elegiac, as if the ghosts of Chicago and Altamont were visible over the horizon as Love looked back to brief moments of warmth. Forever Changes is inarguably Love\'s masterpiece and an album of enduring beauty, but it\'s also one of the few major works of its era that saw the dark clouds looming on the cultural horizon, and the result was music that was as prescient as it was compelling.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Love/Forever+Changes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Taylor was ""essentially homeless"" at the time the album was recorded, either staying in Asher\'s home or crashing on a couch at the house of guitarist Danny Kortchmar or anyone else who would have him.\n\nThe song ""Suite for 20 G"" was so named because Taylor was promised $20,000 once the album was delivered. With one more song needed, he strung together three unfinished songs into a ""suite,"" and completed the album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/James+Taylor/Sweet+Baby+James"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was sold over 9.5 million copies worldwide .\n\nThe album was nominated for six Grammy Awards: Record of the Year (""Girls Just Want to Have Fun""), Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (""Girls Just Want to Have Fun""), Song of the Year (""Time After Time""), Album of the Year, Best Album Package, and Best New Artist, winning the latter two.\n\nIt was produced by Rick Chertoff and William Wittman. Chertoff would go on to produce Nervous Night for The Hooters. He would also team up with Wittman to produce singer-songwriter Patty Smyth\'s debut album, Never Enough for MCA in 1987.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 494 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAllmusic\'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine  gave the record 3.5 stars, calling it ""giddy mix of self-confidence, effervescent popcraft, unabashed sentimentality, subversiveness, and clever humor"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cyndi+Lauper/She%27s+So+Unusual"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the same year the TV network VH1 named Beggars Banquet the 67th greatest album of all time. The album is also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nBeggars Banquet was Brian Jones\'s last full effort with the Rolling Stones. In addition to his slide guitar on ""No Expectations"", he played harmonica on ""Dear Doctor"", ""Parachute Woman"" (along with Mick Jagger) and ""Prodigal Son""; sitar and tambura on ""Street Fighting Man""; mellotron on ""Stray Cat Blues"" and possibly backing vocals on ""Sympathy for the Devil"".\nBy June 1968, the sessions were nearly completed in England, with some final overdubbing and mixing to be done in Los Angeles during July. However, both Decca Records in England and London Records in the US rejected the planned cover design - a graffiti-covered lavatory wall. The band initially refused to change the cover, resulting in several months\' delay in the release of the album. By November, however, the Rolling Stones gave in, allowing the album to be released in December with a simple white cover imitating an invitation card. (The letters R.S.V.P. that appear on this version of the cover are an abbreviation of the French phrase répondez, s\'il vous plaît, which means ""please respond"".) The idea of a plain album cover was also implemented by The Beatles for their eponymous white-sleeved double-album, which was released one month prior to Beggars Banquet. This similarity, coupled with Beggars Banquet\'s later release, garnered the Rolling Stones accusations of imitating the Beatles. In 1984, the original cover art was released with the initial CD remastering of Beggars Banquet. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Beggars+Banquet"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was originally released on May 16, 1990. Primarily produced by The Bomb Squad (Public Enemy\'s production team), the album was an unexpectedly large critical and commercial success, and remains one of the defining hip hop albums of the 1990s.\n\nAfter departing from Ruthless Records and the west coast-based group N.W.A., Ice Cube immediately moved to record his own album. Linking up with Sir Jinx, the cousin of N.W.A. producer Dr. Dre, Cube made use of pre-written notebooks comprised of songs meant for N.W.A. member/Ruthless co-founder Eazy-E. After relocating to New York they worked on the songs, which included ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects,"" ""Get Off My Dick and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here"" and ""Gangsta\'s Fairytale,"" among others.\nAfter contacting Public Enemy\'s production team The Bomb Squad, they completed the album. The album received a fair share of production credited to various Bomb Squad members, with an appearance by Public Enemy frontman Chuck D, despite Jinx\'s claims that the only Bomb Squad member fully present was Eric Sadler. Hank Shocklee spoke on meeting and working with Ice Cube in a Cooleh Magazine interview:\nCube contacted me wanting to know if we could do a few tracks for his solo album after the whole NWA thing came to what it was and I was like, I’ll do it if I can do the whole album. And he said, ""that’s what I was hoping you would say."" And when we were in the studio he showed up with notebooks and notebooks full of new rhymes, a bag full of rhymebooks.\n\nIce Cube\'s social, and political commentary, delivered in an incisive manner, has influenced numerous rappers since Amerikka\'s Most Wanted, particularly in the gangsta rap and political rap subgenres. Focusing on the hardships of life in South Central, Los Angeles, as well as criticizing the American Justice System and race relations in the United States, Cube became an outspoken voice of U.S. social customs tipped against young Black Americans. Under fire from his former group with the diss song ""100 Miles and Runnin\',"" from the EP of the same name, he also recorded the song ""Jackin\' For Beats,"" using beats allegedly meant for the next N.W.A. album, which he released on the Kill at Will EP.\nWith socio-political conscious and gangsta rap content, its songs delve into the issues of ghetto life, drug addiction, racism and poverty. Throughout the album, Ice Cube incessantly attacks institutions for perceived or actual racist tendencies, as well as social norms which directly or indirectly allowed the oppression of those living in the ghettos of Los Angeles to continue. On ""Endangered Species (Tales from the Darkside),"" he predicts that his neighborhood would become a flash point for violence before 1992\'s scandal over the beating of Rodney King, and takes police to task for the policies that would later lead to the L.A. riots that resulted.\nThroughout the album, Cube takes some controversial stands, referring to certain types of African-Americans as ""oreo cookies"", an epithet implying that they appear black on the outside, but have, internally, negative white tendencies. Arsenio Hall is specifically mentioned as being a ""sell-out."" Cube also heavily criticizes R&B and hip hop radio stations for watered-down broadcasting. The title song directly parodies the television show, America\'s Most Wanted, alleging bias and glee the program displays in arresting Afro-American men.\nA later song, ""Get Off My Dick, and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here,"" returns to the same theme at the end, with newscaster Tom Brokaw reporting on rioting, stating: ""Outside the south central area, few cared about the violence because it didn\'t affect them."" He also addressed gender relations on ""It\'s a Man\'s World"", a duet between Cube and female rapper Yo-Yo. Cube and Yo-Yo verbally spar and trade sexist barbs back and forth in an expose of sexism between men and women. Amidst critics\' accusing Ice Cube of sexism, Peter Watrous of the The New York Times wrote, in review of a live show at New York\'s Apollo Theater:\n“...no one came out ahead; any new sense of cultural violence or sexism promoted by the record had dissolved into a traditional battle of the sexes, no better or no worse.\n\nThe title of the album is an allusion to a television show America\'s Most Wanted, wherein real-life crimes are reenacted and viewers are asked to call in with any information about the alleged perpetrators. The show has taken criticism for its reenactments. They are believed to perpetuate stereotypes regarding the criminality of African-American men and other minorities, such as Latinos. The intentional misspelling of ""America"" with three K\'s equates the show and status quo society with the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted initially charted without the support of a lead single or video, although the title track would later receive a pressing, and a rare video for ""Who\'s the Mack?"" eventually surfaced. Regardless of very limited promotion, and airplay, the album shipped 500,000 copies in its first two week out, and was certified Platinum one month later.\nUpon the album\'s release, AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted received mostly positive reviews from critics, and over the years it has been regarded by many as a hip-hop classic. David Jeffries from Allmusic gave the album 5 out of 5 stars and stated; ""This street knowledge venom with ultra fast funk works splendidly throughout the album, with every track hitting home ... AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted is a timeless, riveting exercise in anger, honesty, and the sociopolitical possibilities of hip-hop."" Davis Mills from the Washington Post praised the album for its lyrical dexterity by stating; ""Ice Cube has now proven that he was N.W.A.\'s crucial element. He\'s an unusually gifted rhymer, and his delivery is even more self-assured."" Greg Sandow from Entertainment Weekly complimented the album\'s vivid depictions of urban realities, and stated; ""Ice Cube emerges as a rapper most original for his uncompromising tone. He throws ghetto life in our faces and dares us to draw our own conclusions."" Rolling Stone originally gave the album 2 1/2 out of 5 stars in 1990, with Alan Light commenting that ""The relentless profanity grows wearisome, the Bomb Squad beats lose steam, and Cube\'s attitudes toward women are simply despicable."" He even went on to declare the album as a ""disappointment."" Rolling Stone, however, gave the album 5 out of 5 stars in 2004, and praised the album for its production, and lyrics.\n\nThe title track was the first official single from the album. The song contains samples from ""Humpin\'"" by the Bar-Kays, ""There It Is"" by James Brown, ""Let the Music Take Your Mind"" by Kool and the Gang and ""Advice"" by Sly and the Family Stone. The B-side for the song was ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects"".\n\nProduced largely by the Bomb Squad during the height of Public Enemy\'s success, West Coast rap has largely taken a separate direction from the sound present on AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted, despite its initial success. The scene has instead adopted the glossy beats and smooth drawls popularized by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.\nAlthough Ice Cube\'s popularity among mainstream listeners has lessened since the 2000s, and his sound may be considered distinctively old school to modern ears, many rappers themselves have been influenced by his innovative lyrical techniques. His style of rapping about real life sentiment and socio-political awareness influenced the music of West Coast rappers, including that of Tupac, Ras Kass, and Xzibit, as well as East Coast rappers Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., and more recently, Saigon and Southern rapper Young Jeezy. East Coast rapper Redman also covered ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects"" on his album Doc\'s Da Name 2000, with the song ""Jersey Yo!.""\n\nAccolades:\n\n       Publication       Country         Accolade    Year      Rank\nAbout.com United States 100 Greatest Hip Hop Albums 2008 33\nRobert Dimery United States 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\t2005\t*\nEgo Trip United States Hip Hop\'s 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980-98\t1999\t 1\nThe Guardian United Kingdom 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die\t2007\t*\nMixmag United Kingdom\tThe 100 Best Dance Albums of All Time\t1996\t24\nNew Musical Express\tUnited States\tAlbums of the Year\t1990\t41\nChris Rock United States Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums 2005 17\nRock De Lux Spain Albums of the Year 1990 46\nRolling Stone United States The Essential Recordings of the 90s\t1999\t*\nThe Source United States The 100 Best Rap Albums of All Time\t1998\t*\nSpin\tUnited States Top 100 (+5) Albums of the Last 20 Years\t2005\t33\nSpin\tUnited States Albums of the Year 1990\t1\nSpin\tUnited States Top 90 Albums of the 90s 1999 80\nTom Moon United States 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die\t2008\t*\nVillage Voice United States\tAlbums of the Year 1990 6 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ice+Cube/AmeriKKKa%27s+Most+Wanted"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released in 1969, the album was mostly composed by guitarist Pete Townshend. In 1998 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for ""historical, artistic and significant"" value.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe opera was written to express how Townshend felt after being taught by Meher Baba and other writings and expressing the enlightenment he believes he received — ""a metaphorical story of different states of consciousness.""\n\nCharacters\n\nTommy Walker: The main character of the story, from whom the album gets its name.\n\nCaptain Walker: Tommy\'s father.\n\nMrs. Walker: Tommy\'s mother. (First name given as Nora in the film version)\n\nThe Lover: a romantic partner of Tommy\'s mother. (Uncle Frank Hobbs in the film version)\n\nUncle Ernie: Tommy\'s ""wicked uncle"", a paedophile. The de facto antagonist\n\nCousin Kevin: Tommy\'s cousin, the sadistic ""school bully"" who brutalizes Tommy when left at home with him. The de facto antagonist\n\nThe Hawker: The leader of a cult, where Tommy\'s mother takes him in hope for a cure for his affliction.\n\nLocal Lad: The reigning champion of a pinball tournament, until Tommy defeats him and takes the title of ""Pinball Wizard"". (This character was merged with Cousin Kevin for the Broadway version.)\n\nThe Acid Queen (AKA ""The Gypsy""): A prostitute who deals in hallucinogens and attempts to heal Tommy.\n\nThe Doctor: A doctor who attempts to heal Tommy and finds out that his disabilities are mental rather than physical. (also known as The Specialist, and in the film, ""A. Quackson"" is the payee on Frank\'s check.)\n\nSally Simpson: One of Tommy\'s ""disciples"".\n\nStory in chronological order\n\n""Overture""/""It\'s a Boy"" - British Army Captain Walker is reported missing in action during World War I, and is not expected ever to be seen again. Shortly after his wife, Mrs. Walker, receives this news, she gives birth to their son, Tommy. In the film version, Captain Walker is a Royal Air Force pilot\n\n""1921"" - Approximately four years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. Captain Walker confronts the two and kills the lover. Tommy witnesses this through his mirror. To cover up the crime, Tommy\'s parents tell Tommy that he didn\'t see it, didn\'t hear it, and he will say ""nothing to no one ever in  life"". A traumatized Tommy becomes deaf, dumb, and blind. (In the film version, however, this plot point is changed: Captain Walker confronts his wife and is killed by the lover.)\n\n""Amazing Journey""/""Sparks"" - Tommy\'s subconscious reveals itself to him as a tall stranger dressed in silvery robes, and the vision sets him on an internal spiritual journey upon which he learns to interpret all physical sensations as music.\n\n""Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker)"" - Tommy\'s parents take him to a church of a cult religion to try to cure him. ""Eyesight..."" is the cult leader\'s song.\n\n""Christmas"" - Tommy\'s parents, reminded by the advent of a religious time of year, worry that his soul is at risk of damnation, since he is unaware of Jesus or prayer.\n\n""Cousin Kevin"" - Tommy\'s parents become complacent and leave him in the care of his cousin Kevin, who bullies and tortures Tommy without fear of anyone finding out. He ultimately gets bored with Tommy\'s limited reactions.\n\n""Acid Queen""/""Underture"" - Tommy\'s parents once again try to cure him, this time by placing him in the care of a woman who tries to coax Tommy into full consciousness with hallucinogenic drugs and sex.  ""Underture"" is an extensive instrumental representing Tommy\'s experience on acid.\n\n""Do You Think It\'s Alright?""/""Fiddle About"" - Tommy is left in the care of his uncle Ernie, an alcoholic child molester who, like cousin Kevin, takes the opportunity to abuse Tommy without fear of being caught.\n\n""Pinball Wizard"" - Tommy is discovered to have a talent for pinball, and quickly defeats the game\'s tournament champion. This propels Tommy to international celebrity status. ""Pinball Wizard"" is the reigning champion\'s song.\n\n""There\'s a Doctor""/""Go to the Mirror"" - Tommy\'s parents find a medical specialist to once more try to understand and cure his symptoms. After numerous tests, they are told that there is nothing medically wrong with him, and that his problems are psychosomatic. However, as they are trying to reach him, Tommy\'s subconscious is also trying to reach out to them.\n\n""Tommy Can You Hear Me?""/""Smash the Mirror"" - Tommy\'s mother continues to try to reach him, and becomes frustrated that he completely ignores her while staring directly at a mirror. Out of this frustration she smashes the mirror.\n\n""Sensation""/""Miracle Cure"" - The smashing of the mirror snaps Tommy back into reality. Tommy\'s cure becomes a public sensation and he attains guru-like status. Thereafter he assumes a quasi-messianic mantle and tries to lead his fans to an enlightenment similar to his own.\n\n""Sally Simpson"" - One of Tommy\'s ""disciples"", Sally is a reverend\'s daughter who sneaks out of her home to attend one of Tommy\'s sermons. She ultimately attempts to touch him, only to be thrown from the stage by security and suffers a gash on her face.\n\n""I\'m Free"" - Tommy attempts to spiritually enlighten those that are listening to his sermons. All subsequent versions (except Live at Leeds) place this song immediately after ""Smash the Mirror"" as a direct reaction to his ""cure.""\n\n""Welcome""/""Tommy\'s Holiday Camp"" - Tommy opens his own home to anyone willing to join him, and urges them to bring as many people with them as they can. His house is quickly filled though, so he builds a holiday camp to try to accommodate everybody. Tommy\'s uncle Ernie is running the holiday camp and it\'s implied he is using the camp as an opportunity for profit and is ignoring the camp\'s purpose of heightening people spiritually.\n\n""We\'re Not Gonna Take It"" - Tommy demands that his followers play pinball and blind, deafen and mute themselves in order to truly reach their spiritual height, but the heavy-handedness of his cult and the exploitation of its followers by his family and associates cause his followers to revolt against him. Abandoned by his followers and worshipers, Tommy gains a new enlightenment. This is also the path the movie takes.\n\nIn its original album version, the story is quite scattered, and details were often filled in post facto by Townshend in interviews. As other adaptations of the album appeared, some details were filled out and others were changed. Notably, some later versions change the time frame from post-World War I/1921 to post-World War II/1951. The film version of Tommy also changes a major plot point: instead of Captain Walker killing his wife\'s new lover, the lover kills Captain Walker.\n\nAnalysis and history\n\nWhen Tommy was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative because of its dark theme. The album was banned by the BBC and certain U.S. radio stations. Ultimately, the album became a huge commercial success, as did The Who\'s frequent live performances of the rock opera in the following years, elevating The Who to a new level of prestige and international stardom.\n\nAlthough Tommy is conventionally described as a rock opera, author and Who historian Richard Barnes states that this definition is not strictly correct, since Tommy does not utilise the classic operatic formulae of staging, scenery, acting and recitative. According to Barnes, Tommy could be more accurately described as a ""rock cantata"" or a ""rock song cycle"". It most closely resembles an oratorio (e.g. Handel\'s ""Messiah"") in form, as it includes instrumental, choral and solo sections, with no dialogue between characters, and no sets, costumes or choreography. A counter argument to Barnes would be that new operas are frequently performed without the first three features before a full mounting, similarly to Tommy, and some of its songs, such as ""1921"", ""Christmas"", ""Do You Think It\'s All Right?"" and ""Go to the Mirror"" have the qualities of recitative and dialogue, while it has subsequently been performed with choreography and costuming, including by the Seattle Opera in 1971 and by a Canadian ballet company (dancing to the album recording) shortly thereafter.\n\nMusically, the original album is a complex set of pop-rock arrangements, generally based upon Townshend\'s acoustic guitar and built up with many overdubs by the four members of the band using many instruments, including bass, electric and acoustic guitars, piano, organ, drum kit, gong, timpani, trumpet, French horn, three-part vocal harmonies and occasional doubling on vocal solos. Many of the instruments only appear intermittently—the 10-minute ""Underture"" features a single toot on the horn—and when overdubbed many of the instruments are mixed at low levels. Townshend mixes fingerpicking in with his trademark power chords and fat riffs. His later interest in synthesizers is foreshadowed by the use of taped sounds played in reverse to give a whistling, chirping sound on ""Amazing Journey"".\n\nThe tracks ""Overture"", ""Pinball Wizard"", ""I\'m Free"", and the ""See Me, Feel Me / Listening to You"" reprise were released as singles and were hits on the radio. ""Pinball Wizard"" reached the top 20 in the U.S. and the top five in the UK, and was a hit for Elton John in 1975/76 (who played the part of the pinball champion in the film). ""See Me, Feel Me / Listening To You"" landed high in the top 20 in the U.S. and ""I\'m Free"" reached the top 40. The tracks ""Overture"", ""Christmas"", ""I’m Free"", and ""See Me Feel Me"" were released on an EP in late 1970. The ""Overture"" was also covered by a band called The Assembled Multitude and received a lot of airplay. Tommy was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nSeveral structural precedents for Tommy exist in Townshend\'s work, including ""Glow Girl"" (1968), ""Rael"" (1967), and the sectional work ""A Quick One While He\'s Away"" (1966). In 2004, Uncut released a CD titled The Roots of Tommy containing music that they asserted influenced Tommy\'s creation. Among the included songs are the blues songs that Townshend included or attempted to, such as Mose Allison\'s ""A Young Man"" and Sonny Boy Williamson\'s ""Eyesight to the Blind,"" as well as The Pretty Things\' ""S.F. Sorrow Is Born,"" material from Mark Wirtz\'s A Teenage Opera, and music by groups such as The Zombies, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Nirvana, The Kinks, and music hall comedian Max Miller, who apparently influenced the character of Uncle Ernie.\n\nA year before the album came out Townshend explained his ideas and apparently actually thought out some of the structure of the opera during a famous Rolling Stone interview. John Entwistle claimed years after the release that he had never actually listened to the album because he was so sick of it after the endless takes and re-takes.\n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 96 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was ranked #90 on VH1\'s 100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll and appears in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. NME named it the 16th on ""NME Writers All Time Top 100"" in 1974.

The name of the song itself is a spoof on Motörhead\'s No Sleep \'til Hammersmith album. King\'s appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously (Slayer\'s Reign in Blood was originally released on Def Jam).\n\nThe full album cover, front to back, features a Boeing 727 — with ""Beastie Boys"" emblazoned on the tail — crashing head-on into the side of a mountain. The tail of the plane has the Def Jam logo and the legend \'3MTA3\' which spells \'EATME\' when viewed in a mirror.\n\nThe original title for this album was Don\'t Be a Faggot but Columbia Records flatly refused to release the album with this title and pressured Russell Simmons (their manager and label Def Jam head) into having the Beastie Boys to come up with another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the band\'s earlier title.\n\nMusic videos were made for the songs ""Fight for Your Right"", ""No Sleep Til Brooklyn"", ""Hold It Now, Hit It"", ""Rhymin\' and Stealin\'"" and ""She\'s Crafty"".\n\nReception\n\nIn 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source\'s 100 Best Rap Albums.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nVibe (12/99, p.158) - Included in Vibe\'s 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n\nQ magazine (9/94, p.123) - 4 Stars - ""Licensed to Ill remains the world\'s only punk rock rap album, arguably superior to Never Mind the Bollocks...knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner.""\n\nMelody Maker (7/22/95, p.35) - Bloody Essential - ""There\'s lots of self-reverential bragging, more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and, most importantly of all, an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive....A surprisingly enduring classic."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys/Licensed+to+Ill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bad is the first album ever to feature five Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles.\n\nJackson began recording demos for the anticipated follow-up to Thriller a few months after his last performance with The Jacksons after their successful Victory Tour. Recording took place between November 1986 and July 9, 1987 (except for ""Another Part of Me"" which was recorded for Captain EO in 1986). Jackson wrote a reported sixty songs for the new album and recorded thirty, wanting to use them all on a three-disc set. Instead his longtime producer Quincy Jones cut it down to ten tracks and a bonus song making it a single LP. The CD release contained the bonus track, ""Leave Me Alone"". Jackson wrote nine of the eleven tracks himself while Terry Britten (writer of Tina Turner\'s ""What\'s Love Got to Do With It"") and Graham Lyle wrote ""Just Good Friends"" and Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard wrote ""Man in the Mirror"". Contributions from other musicians included Stevie Wonder who sung a duet with Jackson on ""Just Good Friends"" while Steve Stevens contributed a guitar solo for ""Dirty Diana"". Originally Jones wanted ""Bad"" to have been a duet between Jackson and Prince; but apparently, Prince told him that the song ""would be a hit without (him) on it"". Years later, Prince (jokingly) explained his reason for declining was over either artist singing the song\'s ""your butt is mine"" lyric. Another song, ""I Just Can\'t Stop Loving You"", was also supposed to feature a famous female singer. Reportedly Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston all turned down the duet offer. R&B singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett was picked by Quincy Jones to sing with him on the song. According to Jones, song choices were difficult. For instance: he and Jackson deliberated over two MJ compositions intended for the album. One: ""Streetwalker"" favoured by the artist, and Jones\' choice: ""Another Part of Me"". Jones said the dilemma was decided by Jackson\'s portly manager Frank DiLeo ""shaking his butt"" to ""Another Part of Me"". Jones joked: Jackson verbally chastised DiLeo, who he nicknamed ""Rubba"", for it.\n\nBy the time Jackson released this album, sales of its predecessor, Thriller, had already reached forty million, raising expectations for Bad. Bad became the first of Jackson\'s albums to debut at number-one on the Billboard 200 where it remained for the next six consecutive weeks. The RIAA certified Bad for having sold eight million copies in the U.S. alone. In the U.K, the album sold 500,000 copies in just five days and is currently certified 13x platinum, for sales of 3.9 million making it Jackson\'s biggest-selling album in the UK. Globally, it\'s Jackson\'s overall third best-selling recording, behind ""Thriller"" and ""Dangerous"", with 30 million copies sold.\n\nJackson set another record with this album, becoming the first - and currently, only artist to have five songs to hit number-one from one album. In July 2006, it was announced by the The Official UK Charts Company that Bad was the ninth biggest selling album in British history. It turned out to be the last collaborative effort by Jackson and Jones, as Jackson moved on to write and produce more of his own records, particularly with Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Rodney Jerkins.\n\nRolling Stone stated that ""even without a milestone recording like ""Billie Jean"", Bad is still a better record than Thriller."" The magazine further went on to say that the ""filler"" content in Bad - including songs such as ""Speed Demon"", ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Liberian Girl"" - is written by Jackson himself, making Bad ""richer, sexier and better than Thriller\'s forgettables.""\n\nDespite the records success, in a poll of 23,000 US citizens, released by Rolling Stone, Jackson won ""worst album"" for Bad and ""worst single"" for ""Bad"". TIME gave the opinion that the singer was suffering a backlash in certain parts of the US. The publication suggested that the singer\'s media image was triggering the poll, not the music.\n\nIn 2001, a special edition was released with three new songs and a new booklet containing lyrics and never-before-seen photos.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 202 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Bad"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Seen by later critics as a reaction against the psychedelic band-oriented styles (as were the country-rock developments of 1968 and 1969) enjoying a vogue in 1967, determining whether indeed the singer-songwriters were \'reacting against\' the baroque tapestries of Sgt. Pepper or the San Francisco bands is problematic.\n\nInstigated by the work of Bob Dylan, singer-songwriters appeared to be folk singers on the surface, but were not allied to the folk movement\'s politics or repertoire, instead performing original material in styles at times reminiscent of the folk singers of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Songs of Leonard Cohen was one of the first in this new sub-genre, along with the debut albums of Laura Nyro, Tim Buckley, Neil Young, and Joni Mitchell, propelling the approach to an eventual position of dominance in the early 1970s. Judy Collins, one of the first of the \'traditional\' folk singers to champion new writers such as Mitchell and Cohen, along with actor Noel Harrison previously had hits performing the song ""Suzanne"" (in 1966 and 1967 respectively).\n\nCohen and John Simon, producer and musical director, managed to give the album a distinct sound while also relying on typical sixties effects such as instruments panning from channel to channel. Although Cohen was granted much freedom in the recording process, they did not always agree on how the record should be mixed. Finally, Simon departed for his Christmas holiday and left the final mix to the artist himself. In a 2001 interview Cohen told British music magazine Mojo: ""We did have a falling out over the song ""Suzanne."" He wanted a heavy piano syncopated and maybe drums and I didn\'t want drums on any of my songs, so that was a bone of contention.""\n\nOn some of the tracks Cohen was backed by strings, the band Kaleidoscope and Nancy Priddy\'s vocals. The original producer was John Hammond, who signed Cohen to Columbia, but he was replaced by Simon because of health problems.\n\n""Suzanne"", which begins and ends as an ode to a ""half-crazy"" woman capable of personal connection, contains a discussion of Jesus in the second verse which has been removed in at least one cover of the song, ""Suzanne"" was ranked 41st on Pitchfork Media\'s \'Top 200 Songs of the 1960s\'. The track ""So Long, Marianne"" also featured on the list – ranked 190th.\nThree of the album\'s songs, ""Winter Lady,"" ""The Stranger Song,"" and ""Sisters of Mercy,"" were used in the 1971 Robert Altman film McCabe & Mrs. Miller.\n\nSongs of Leonard Cohen was released on CD in 1989, while a digipak edition was released in some European countries in 2003. A remastered version, with bonus tracks, was released in the United States on April 24, 2007, and in Japan on June 20, 2007. The Japanese version was a limited edition replica of the original record album cover with lyric card insert.\nIn 2009, the album (including the 2007 bonus tracks) was included in Hallelujah - The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection, an 8-CD box set issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.\nOn the vinyl and remastered versions is a picture of Saint Bernadette of Lourdes in a fire looking towards heaven. According to the liner notes, apparently Cohen had collected the picture when he was much younger. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leonard+Cohen/Songs+of+Leonard+Cohen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album also features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, DJ Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nInspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the ornate, soul-based sound of West\'s previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. Graduation concludes the education theme of West\'s first two albums The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).\n\nGraduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits ""Stronger"", ""Good Life"" and ""Homecoming"", the former of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. The album received widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album of the Year. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between Graduation and rapper 50 Cent\'s Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\nGraduation is the third installment of West\'s planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).’The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West\'s musical style and approach to production. After spending the previous year touring the world with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West became inspired by watching Bono open the stadium tours every night to incredible ovations and sought out to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large stadiums and arenas. In West\'s attempt to accomplish this ""stadium-status"" endeavor, West incorporated layered electronic synthesizers into his hip-hop production, which also finds him utilizing slower tempos, being influenced by the music of the 1980s, and experimenting with electronic music. West was particularly influenced by house music, a subgenre of electronic dance music that first originated in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s. West has stated that growing up, he would listen to hip-hop music at home or in his car, but when he felt like dancing, he would attend a house club. While he rarely listened to house at home, he still felt it was an important part of his culture and background.\n\nWest further broadened his musical palette on Graduation by not limiting himself to his customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, for much of the third studio album, West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono\'s operatic singing. West altered his vocabulary, he utilised less percussive consonants for his vocal delivery in favor of smoother vowel harmonies. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.\n\nWest made a conscious decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Due largely to these factors and the inclusion of layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. He also acknowledged that the differences did not in and of themselves make Graduation a good album; however, he felt it was an accurate representation of the music he was listening to and inspired by at that time.\n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Graduation"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It followed an abandoned session for RCA Records, and was recorded and mixed over three weekends at Strawberry Studios, Stockport in April 1979 with record producer Martin Hannett. The cover artwork was designed by artist Peter Saville.\n\nFactory did not release any singles from the album, and it did not chart despite the relative success of the group\'s non-album debut single ""Transmission"". Unknown Pleasures has gone on to receive sustained critical acclaim as a pioneering and influential post-punk album. It has been named as one of the best albums ever by publications such as NME, AllMusic, and Select.\n\nUnknown Pleasures was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport over three weekends between 1 and 17 April 1979, with Martin Hannett producing. Describing Hannett\'s production techniques, Hook said, "" didn\'t think straight, he thought sideways. He confused you and made you do something you didn\'t expect."" Hook went on to say, ""Derek Bramwood of Strawberry Studios said that you can take a group that have got on brilliantly for 20 years, put them in a studio with Martin and within five minutes, they\'ll be trying to slash each other\'s throats."" However, Hook went on to say that Hannett was only as good as the material he had to work with, ""We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients.""\n\nHannett used a number of unusual sound effects and production techniques on the album; including the sound of a bottle smashing, someone eating crisps, backwards guitar and the sound of the Strawberry Studios lift with a Leslie speaker ""whirring inside"". He also used the sound of a basement toilet, as well as several AMS 15-80s digital delays and a couple of Marshall Time Modulators, tape echo and bounce. Hannett recorded Curtis\'s vocals for ""Insight"" down a telephone line so he could achieve the ""requisite distance"". Referring to the recording sessions, Hook remembered, ""Sumner started using a kit-built Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser, most notably on \'I Remember Nothing\', where it vied with the sound of Rob Gretton smashing bottles with Steve and his Walther replica pistol."" In his words, ""Morris ... had invested in a syndrum because he thought he saw one on the cover of Can\'s Tago Mago: ""you triggered it by hitting it.  frowned on it because he wasn\'t the one doing the triggering.""\n\nThe band members\' opinions differed on the ""spacious, atmospheric sound"" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Sumner said, ""The music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars. The production inflicted this dark, doomy mood over the album: we\'d drawn this picture in black and white, and Martin had coloured it in for us. We resented it ..."" Hook said, ""I couldn\'t hide my disappointment then, it sounded like Pink Floyd."" Morris disagreed, saying, ""I was happy with Unknown Pleasures. My theory on things at the time was that the two things—listening to a record and going to a gig—were quite different. You don\'t want to hear a record when you go to a gig: you want something with a bit of energy."" Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett\'s work. Hook conceded in 2006, ""It definitely didn\'t turn out sounding the way I wanted it ... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it ... There\'s no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound."" Hook also noted that he was able to hear Curtis\'s lyrics and Sumner\'s guitar parts for the first time on the record, because during gigs the band played too loudly.\n\nIn 1994, Jon Savage described the music as ""a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic"". Analysing Curtis\'s work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: ""sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything\'s (perhaps) lost"".\n\nPeter Saville, who had previously designed posters for Manchester\'s Factory club in 1978, designed the cover of the album. Sumner chose the image used on the cover, which is based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. Saville reversed the image from black-on-white to white-on-black and printed it on textured card for the original version of the album. It is not a Fourier analysis, but rather an image of the intensity of successive radio pulses, as stated in the Cambridge Encyclopaedia. The image was originally created by radio astronomer Harold Craft at the Arecibo Observatory for his 1970 PhD thesis.\n\nThis image became well-known, featuring on T-shirts (even parodied by a quickly-withdrawn Disney shirt). When reviewing the 2007 remastered version of Unknown Pleasures, Pitchfork critic Joshua Klein described the cover art as ""iconic"". Susie Goldring, reviewing the album for BBC Online said, ""The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes. Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\'t draw you in, the music will.""\n\nThe inner sleeve features a black-and-white photograph of a door with a hand near the handle. It was some years later before Saville discovered that the photograph was Hand Through a Doorway, a well-known picture by Ralph Gibson. Author Chris Ott suggests that the album title was probably a reference to Marcel Proust\'s Remembrance of Things Past. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division/Unknown+Pleasures"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It has been described as ""a bridge between the lo-fi darkness of Roman Candle and Elliott Smith and the studio sheen of XO and Figure 8"".\n\nThe album\'s title derives from the Søren Kierkegaard book of the same name, in which ""either/or"" refers to the contrast between aesthetic/subjective experience and ethical/objective being. This existential title is reflective of Smith\'s interest in philosophy, which he studied at Hampshire College in Massachusetts.\n\nDirector Gus Van Sant was highly impressed with the album, incorporating three of its songs; Between the Bars, Angeles and Say Yes along with a new song, Miss Misery, into the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Miss Misery was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1998 Academy Awards, and was performed at the televised ceremony in an abridged version by Smith, backed by the house orchestra, briefly propelling him into the international spotlight. Online magazine Pitchfork ranked Either/Or 59th in its list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1990s. Spin ranked Either/Or at number 48 on its list of the best albums from 1987 to 2012. Blender ranked it thirty-sixth in its ""100 Greatest Indie Rock Albums Ever"" list. In 2013, NME placed Either/Or at number 149 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Consequence of Sound ranked the album No. 97 on their list of best albums ever. Rolling Stone ranked the album at 216 on the 2020 re-release of their \'The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\' list. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith/Either%2FOr"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 377 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nProduction\n\nIn CrazySexyCool TLC toned down the boisterousness of their first record in favor of a smoother, more mature presentation. They were more involved in crafting their own material. The album\'s sound was more of a blend of R&B/soul and hip hop music that became the commercial and critical high point of the group\'s career. For the album TLC received production help from a number of A list R&B and Hip hop producers including Babyface (Diggin\' On You, Let\'s Do It Again, and Red Light Special), Dallas Austin (Creep, Case Of The Fake People, and Take Our Time), Jermaine Dupri (Kick Your Game and Switch), Organized Noize (Waterfalls and Sumthin\' Wicked This Way Comes, and Sean ""Puffy"" Combs & Chucky Thompson for The Hitmen (If I Was Your Girlfriend and the Interludes). Other contributors to the album include Prince (who wrote the song If I Was Your Girlfriend) and André 3000 of OutKast (who was featured in the song Sumthin\' Wicked This Way Comes).\n\nAlbum Title\n\nThe title refers to the different attributes that make up the personalities of each group member, Lisa Lopes having more of the crazy side in her, Rozonda ""Chilli"" Thomas representing the sexier element of the group, and Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins being the cool member. The three words together create one word, ""CrazySexyCool"", which describes all women\'s personalities.\n\nCritical reception\n\nCrazySexyCool received overall positive feedback from fans and music critics.\n\nAllmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 5 out of 5 stars stating ""On their second album, TLC downplay their overt rap connections, recording a smooth, seductive collection of contemporary soul reminiscent of both Philly soul and Prince, powered by new jack and hip-hop beats. Lisa Lopes contributes the occasional rap, but the majority of CrazySexyCool belongs to Tionne Watkins and Rozonda Thomas. While they aren\'t the most accomplished vocalists -- they have a tendency to be just slightly off-key -- the material they sing is consistently strong. As the cover of Prince\'s ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"" indicates, TLC favor erotic, mid-tempo funk. Yet the group removes any of the psychosexual complexities of Prince\'s songs, leaving a batch of sexy material that just sounds good, especially the hit singles. Both ""Creep"" and ""Red Light Special"" have a deep groove that accentuates the slinky hooks, but it\'s ""Waterfalls,"" with its gently insistent horns and guitar lines and instantly memorable chorus, that ranks as one of the classic R&B songs of the \'90s""\n\nCrazySexyCool won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best R&B Album\n\nIn 2003 CrazySexyCool was listed as one of Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Coming in a 377, Rolling Stone said that ""Things were not well with TLC during the making of CrazySexyCool: Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes was lighting fires, and the group was in a financial slide that would end in bankruptcy proceedings. But they emerged with the most effervescent and soulful R&B pop anyone had seen since the Supremes.""\n\nCommercial Success\n\nThe album became one of the most successful R&B albums ever released, selling over fifteen million worldwide. The album features two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits: ""Creep"" and ""Waterfalls"". Other successful singles included ""Diggin\' On You"" and ""Red Light Special"". The album was RIAA certified Diamond denoting over ten million sold, and went on to 11 x Platinum in the US.\n\nCreep\n\n""Creep"" was the first single from CrazySexyCool. It was TLC\'s first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, (fourth number one total). It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks, and became the second best-selling single of 1996, behind Madonna\'s ""Take a Bow"". TLC won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Dallas Austin was nominated for Best R&B Song. It was the 3rd most successful Hot 100 Single of 1995, according to Billboard\'s Year End Charts.\n\n Red Light Special\n\n""Red Light Special"" was the second single from CrazySexyCool. The song peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The two guitar solos that runs through the whole song are written and played by Slash.\n\n Waterfalls\n\n""Waterfalls"" was the third single from CrazySexyCool. It became TLC\'s second number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and the group\'s signature song. The song was produced by the Organized Noize team and written by Marqueze Etheridge, TLC member Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes, and Organized Noize. It was the 2nd biggest Hot 100 Single of 1995, according to Billboard\'s Year End Charts.\n\n Diggin\' On You\n\n""Diggin\' on You"" was the fourth single from CrazySexyCool. The song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #7 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/TLC/CrazySexyCool"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 148 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nDéjà Vu was greatly anticipated after the popularity of the first CSN album and the addition of Young to the group. Stills estimates that the album took around 800 hours of studio time to record; this figure may be exaggerated, even though the individual tracks display meticulous attention to detail. The songs, except for ""Woodstock"", were recorded as individual sessions by each member, with each contributing whatever was needed that could be agreed upon. Young does not appear on all of the tracks, and drummer Dallas Taylor and bassist Greg Reeves are credited on the cover with their names in slightly smaller typeface. Jerry Garcia plays pedal steel on ""Teach Your Children"" and John Sebastian plays mouth-harp on the title track.\n\nThe popularity of the album contributed to the success of the four albums released by each of the members in the wake of Déjà Vu: Neil Young\'s After the Gold Rush, Stephen Stills\' self-titled solo debut, David Crosby\'s If I Could Only Remember My Name, and Graham Nash\'s Songs for Beginners.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 148 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The same year, the TV network VH1 named Déjà Vu the 61st greatest album of all time. The album ranked at #14 for the Top 100 Albums of 1970 and #217 overall by Rate Your Music.\n\nThe album was reissued for compact disc after being remastered from the original tapes at Ocean View Digital by Joe Gastwirt on September 6, 1994. In 1997, guitarist Fareed Haque covered the entire album in jazz form for the Blue Note Cover Series.\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Crosby,+Stills,+Nash+&+Young/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0+Vu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album is known for its high production values, which are almost to the strictest audiophile standards. Some audiophile sites and magazines even go as far as using the album — in particular the song ""Take the Power Back"" — to test amplifiers and speakers.\n\nAcclaimed BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe named Rage Against the Machine as one of four albums to be added to his list of \'Masterpieces\', and his personal favourite album, on December 2nd, 2008.\n\nThe cover artwork features a famous photo of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, burning himself to death in Saigon in 1963. The monk was protesting President Ngô Đình Diệm\'s administration for oppressing the Buddhist religion. The photograph drew international attention and persuaded U.S. President John F. Kennedy to withdraw support of the Ngô Đình Diệm\'s government. It was taken by Associated Press correspondent Malcolm Browne; a similar photograph earned the award of World Press Photo of the Year in 1963.\n\nActivists such as Provisional IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands and Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton are listed in the ""Thanks For Inspiration"" section. Also thanked were Ian and Alec MacKaye – de la Rocha was straight edge at the time, though he later took up smoking.\n\nThe lyrics for each song were printed in the album booklet with the exception of those for ""Killing in the Name"", which were omitted; the booklet reads ""2. KILLING IN THE NAME"", skips the lyrics and continues with the next song.\n\nThe statement ""no samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this record"" can be found at the end of the sleeve notes, and similar statements were made in the band\'s subsequent albums. The band also refer to themselves as ""Guilty Parties"" for each album.\n\n""Wake Up"" is featured in the credits of The Matrix and in the video game Dave Mirra\'s Freestyle BMX 2, while ""Killing in the Name"" is featured in the video games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Guitar Hero II. Edits of ""Bombtrack"" and ""Take the Power Back"" are featured in the Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine/Rage+Against+the+Machine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is a pop and dance record, yet, it contains elements of electronic music within its composition, making it a departure from her previous work. Additionally, it incorporates several genres and subgenres, including techno and ambient. The album has several themes, including spirituality. \n\nAfter giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard and William Orbit in developing the album. After failed sessions with other producers, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with Orbit and incorporated his extensive usage of trance and electronic music in her songs. The recording took place over four months, but experienced problems with the Pro Tools arrangement by Orbit as well as the absence of live bands.\n\nHowever, upon release, the album was lauded by contemporary critics as a music masterpiece of the decade. Reviewers complimented the album for its mature, restrained nature as well as commending Madonna\'s musical direction, calling it her ""most adventurous"" record. In such a way, the album has been included in many critic lists and polls, including Rolling Stone magazine\'s ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"".\n\nCommercially, the album was a success on the world charts, peaking at number one in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and mainland Europe. On the U.S. Billboard 200, the album debuted and peaked at number two. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Quadruple Platinum on March 16, 2000, recognizing four million shipments in the United States, making it her fifth best-selling recording there. Worldwide sales of the album have surpassed 20 million copies.\n\nFive singles were released from the album. The first single, ""Frozen"" was an international success, as was the second one, ""Ray of Light"", which won a number of awards for its music video. In 1999, the album received three Grammy Awards, including ""Best Pop Vocal Album"", and ""Best Dance Recording."" In 2003, the album was ranked #363 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Madonna has performed songs from this album on a number of her world tours, most recently the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008-09). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/Ray+of+Light"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The difference, he said, was that Imagine was ""chocolate-coated for public consumption"", in reference to the string sections prevalent throughout the album.\n\nBasic tracks for the album were recorded in his home studio (Ascot Sound Studios in Tittenhurst Park) with strings overdubs added at the Record Plant in New York City. As on his last album, Phil Spector joined Lennon and Yoko Ono as co-producer on Imagine. Extensive footage of the sessions, showing the evolution of some of the songs, was compiled on a video documentary entitled Gimme Some Truth: The Making of John Lennon\'s Imagine.\n\nThe title track ""Imagine"" became Lennon\'s signature tune and was written as a plea for world peace. ""Jealous Guy"" has also had enduring popularity and was originally composed as ""Child of Nature"" during the songwriting sessions in India in 1968 that led to The Beatles\' double-album The Beatles. ""Oh My Love"" and the song ""How?"" were influenced by his experience with primal therapy: ""How?"" contains the questions he was facing while going through the changes produced in him during the ongoing process of primal therapy, while ""Oh My Love"" was written to communicate the joy and growth Lennon was experiencing as a result of the therapy.\n\nLennon also indulged his love of rock and roll with ""Crippled Inside"" and ""It\'s So Hard."" ""Gimme Some Truth"", originally heard in the Let It Be sessions, appears on the album with a new bridge. The politically-themed ""I Don\'t Wanna Be a Soldier"" closes the first half of Imagine in a cacophonous manner.\n\nGeorge Harrison guested on a few of Imagine\'s tracks, most infamously ""How Do You Sleep?"", Lennon\'s response to what he considered veiled remarks about him on Paul McCartney\'s then-current album Ram. Although Lennon softened his stance in the mid-70s and claimed he wrote the song about himself, he revealed in 1980, ""I used my resentment against Paul... to create a song... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and The Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write \'How Do You Sleep\'. I don\'t really go \'round with those thoughts in my head all the time"".\n\nEarly editions of the Imagine LP included a postcard featuring a photo of Lennon holding a pig in mockery of McCartney\'s similar pose with a sheep of the cover of Ram. At the end of the album is ""Oh Yoko!"", a ode to his wife complete with a Bob Dylan-style harmonica solo.\n\nUpon release in September and October 1971, Imagine was warmly regarded by critics and promptly went to #1 worldwide and became an enduring seller, with the title track reaching #3 in the U.S. and #1 in the UK following Lennon\'s death. In 2000, Yoko Ono supervised the remixing of Imagine for its remastered reissue.\n\nIn 2003, Imagine was placed at #76 in Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and reissued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab on gold CD and on 180 gram half-speed mastered vinyl. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Imagine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was recorded at Sound City in Van Nuys and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood. The title is a reference to a famous quote by Admiral David Farragut: ""Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"".\n\nDamn the Torpedoes was released in October of 1979. The album was a breakthrough for Petty and the Heartbreakers. It was his first top 10 album rising to #2 hit (for seven weeks and kept from #1 by Pink Floyd\'s The Wall) on the Billboard\'s Albums chart. It yielded two songs that made the top-fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100  singles chart, ""Don\'t Do Me Like That"" (#10) and ""Refugee"" (#15). It was a commercial success as well. Thanks to the new co-producer Jimmy Iovine, Damn the Torpedoes proved to be a major leap forward in production. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty+and+The+Heartbreakers/Damn+the+Torpedoes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Giant Steps bore the double-edged sword of furthering the cause of the art-form as well as delivering it to an increasingly mainstream audience. Although this was John Coltrane\'s debut for Atlantic, he was concurrently performing and recording with Miles Davis during this period. Within the space of less than three weeks, Coltrane would complete his work with Davis and company on another art-form-defining album, Kind of Blue, before commencing his efforts on this one. Coltrane (tenor sax) is flanked by essentially two different trios. Recording commenced in early May of 1959 with a pair of sessions that featured Tommy Flanagan (piano) and Art Taylor (drums), as well as Paul Chambers -- who was the only band member other than Coltrane to have performed on every date.\n\nWhen recording resumed in December of that year, Wynton Kelly (piano) and Jimmy Cobb (drums) were instated -- replicating the lineup featured on Kind of Blue, sans Miles Davis of course. At the heart of these recordings, however, is the laser-beam focus of Coltrane\'s tenor solos. All seven pieces issued on the original Giant Steps are likewise Coltrane compositions. He was, in essence, beginning to rewrite the so-called  jazz canon with material that would be centered on solos -- the 180-degree antithesis of the art-form up to that point. These arrangements would create a place for the solo to become infinitely more compelling. This would culminate in a frenetic performance style that noted so-called jazz journalist Ira Gitler accurately dubbed ""sheets of sound.""\n\nColtrane\'s poly-tonal torrents extricate the amicable and otherwise cordial solos that had begun decaying the very exigency of the art-form-- turning it into the equivalent of easy listening. He wastes no time as the album\'s title track immediately indicates a progression from which there would be no looking back. Line upon line of highly cerebral improvisation snake between the melody and solos, practically fusing the two. The resolute intensity of ""Countdown"" does more to modernize so-called  jazz in 141 seconds than many artists do in their entire careers. \n\nTellingly, the contrasting and ultimately pastoral ""Naima"" was the last tune to be recorded, and is the only\ntrack on the original long-player to feature the Kind of Blue quartet. What is lost in tempo is more than recouped in intrinsic melodic beauty. Both Giant Steps  and the seven-disc Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings offer more comprehensive presentations of these sessions. \n\nRelease Date :January, 1960\nDuration: 01:02:40\nAfrican-American Classical \nStyle: Hard Bop\nRecording Date: May 4, 1959 - December 2, 1959 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/Giant+Steps"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song Take Me With You was recorded during these sessions, but not released until 2006 (with re-recorded vocals.)

Amos and Rosse also went to Stag Studios to use a Yamaha grand piano. Satisfied with these recordings, Atlantic determined that the album Little Earthquakes would have 13 tracks, removing Learning to Fly and adding four from the December recording session.\n\nAmos moved to London to work with Ian Stanley; Atlantic thought Amos would have an easier time of achieving success, because of English appreciation for eccentric performers. Here she recorded what would become two of her early singles. Me And A Gun was the last song written for the album, while China was an early track, originally titled Distance, that she wrote in 1987.\n\nThe second final version of the album was accepted by the record company. However, this was still revised before the final release; a 13-track promo cassette shows that the song Little Earthquakes was to appear after Happy Phantom on side one, with side two closing with Flying Dutchman. The latter track was presumably dropped due to the physical restraints of the vinyl LP format.\n\nAtlantic\'s European counterpart, East West, promoted the record extensively. Amos spent much of 1991 performing in small bars and clubs in London and playing for music executives and journalists, often in her own apartment. The Me and a Gun EP containing four tracks was released in October 1991, receiving considerable critical attention. The single was re-issued the following month with Silent All These Years as the lead composition, and it became her first chart entry at UK number 51 following Single of the Week support from BBC Radio 1 and a TV debut on the high-rated chat show of Jonathan Ross on Channel 4. The back cover of the album contains pictures of phallus mushrooms, also known as stinkhorns. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos/Little+Earthquakes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Metallica is the band\'s best-selling album to date, with over 16 million physical copies sold in the United States and over 31 million copies worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.\n\nThe album cover features only the band\'s logo, angled against the upper left corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the Gadsden flag, ""Don\'t Tread on Me"", is also the title of a song featured on the album.\n\nThe cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap\'s Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).\n\nMetallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.\n\nWhile the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band\'s first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad ""Nothing Else Matters"". Moreover, following the success of ""One,"" the breakaway single from their …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. (""Enter Sandman"", ""Nothing Else Matters"", ""Sad but True"", ""Wherever I May Roam"" and ""The Unforgiven"").\n\nThe lyrics of The Black Album, written by James Hetfield, were much more personal and introspective in nature than previous Metallica albums. For example, ""The God That Failed"" dealt with Hetfield\'s mother\'s death from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment. ""Nothing Else Matters"" expresses the connection Hetfield felt with a girlfriend while out on the road. The album ended Metallica\'s tradition of including a lengthy instrumental track on each album until their 2008 album Death Magnetic.\n\n    * Rolling Stone (9/5/91) - 5 Stars — Excellent — Included in Rolling Stone\'s ""Essential Recordings of the 90\'s"" - ""Several songs...seem destined to become hard-rock classics.... effectively bridg the gap between commercial metal and the much harder thrash of Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth."" In 2003, the album was ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n    * Spin (9/99, p.146) - Ranked #52 in Spin Magazine\'s ""90 Greatest Albums of the \'90s"" - Spin (p.89) - ""This record\'s diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band\'s melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads.""\n\n    * Entertainment Weekly (8/16/91) - ""Rock\'s preeminent speed-metal cyclone...Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash."" - Rating: B+\n\n    * Q magazine (8/00, p.127) - Included in Q\'s ""Best Metal Albums of All Time"" - ""Transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars....bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power.""\n\n    * Melody Maker (12/91) - Ranked #16 in Melody Maker\'s list of the top 30 albums of 1991 - ""In a committed move away from their thrash roots, Metallica was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they\'d done before.""\n\n\nMetallica was produced by Bob Rock, who was originally asked to mix the album as the band was impressed with his work as producer on the Mötley Crüe album, Dr. Feelgood. Initially, the band was not interested in having Rock produce their album, but changed their minds as Ulrich stated; ""We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob  could help us make it."" The Black Album\'s sound was a marked difference from the stripped down production of the previous album. Rock altered the band\'s working schedule and routine so much that they swore never to work with him again. The animosity and tension between band and producer was documented in the documentaries A Year And A Half In The Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: The Black Album. Both explore and document the intense and merciless recording process that resulted in The Black Album.\n\nDespite the controversies between the band and Rock, he continued to work with the band up until, and including, the 2003 album St. Anger.\n\nThe world tour following the Metallica album, initially dubbed the ""Wherever We May Roam Tour"" and then later the ""Nowhere Else To Roam Tour"", saw Metallica on the road for the next three years. The tour was in part documented in the A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary, as well as the 3-CD, 2-DVD (or 3-VHS) boxset Live Shit: Binge & Purge. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Metallica"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house, which they were previously known for, to disco, post-disco and synthpop-inspired house. \n\n\nThe album provided itself as a soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which was a collaboration between the creators of the album, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei Animation. All of the music videos for the tracks on the album are segments of the film. Interstella 5555 follows a story of a kidnapped extraterrestrial band. Discovery is recognized as a concept album in reviews by New Musical Express and Spin magazines. Early versions of the album included a ""Daft Club"" membership card. The card included a code which granted access to an online music service, which featured tracks later released on the album of the same name and Alive 1997.\n\nTheme\n\nAccording to an interview with Remix Magazine Online, Thomas Bangalter stated:\n\nThis album has a lot to do with our childhood and the memories of the state we were in at that stage of our lives. It\'s about our personal relationship to that time. It\'s less of a tribute to the music from 1975 to 1985 as an era, and more about focusing on the time when we were zero to ten years old. When you\'re a child you don\'t judge or analyze music. You just like it because you like it. You\'re not concerned with whether it\'s cool or not. Sometimes you might relate to just one thing in a song, such as the guitar sound. This album takes a playful, fun, and colorful look at music. It\'s about the idea of looking at something with an open mind and not asking too many questions. It\'s about the true, simple, and honest relationship you have with music when you\'re open to your own feelings.\n\nLeiji Matsumoto supervised the creation of several music videos for Discovery. The videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. It was created as a collaboration between Matsumoto, Daft Punk, Cédric Hervet and Toei Animation. The film features the entire album as its soundtrack. Regarding the album from the perspective of animation, Daft Punk stated that, ""We think the music we made on Discovery has been done in a cinematic way in our minds. We were visually seeing the music and trying to find ideas that were appealing to people\'s imagination. An animation fan would find this mixture of elements and story in our music.""\n\nProduction\n\nA significant amount of sampling is present on the album. Rather than simply creating new music out of the samples, Daft Punk worked with them by writing and adding instrumental performance. The Discovery liner notes specify permitted use of samples for four tracks on the album: Part of George Duke\'s ""I Love You More"" is featured in ""Digital Love""; Edwin Birdsong\'s ""Cola Bottle Baby"" was sampled for ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger""; The Imperials song ""Can You Imagine"" is used for ""Crescendolls""; Barry Manilow\'s ""Who\'s Been Sleeping In My Bed"" is credited for ""Superheroes"".\nSeveral websites list many other samples present on the album, but Bangalter has stated that half of the samples listed are not true. He also stated the sampling they do is legitimately done, not something they try to hide. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on Discovery was played live by the duo:\n“ I play more guitar usually, and Thomas plays more keyboards and bass. There\'s no ego involved. We don\'t argue about who\'s playing what. You can get the sound of a guitar with a keyboard, or the opposite. We don\'t really care about who\'s doing what as long as it\'s well-done. At the same time, when you use samples, you don\'t have this problem. When you use a sampler, nobody plays on it, so the problem of the ego of the musician is not really there. For everything that we do, no matter how you get to the results, the important thing is the result. ”\n\nFeatured artists\n\nThe album features guest appearances by Romanthony, Todd Edwards and DJ Sneak. In regard to working with guest artists, de Homem-Christo stated:\n“ We met Romanthony at the 1996 Winter Music Conference and became friends. Before that, we mentioned his name on “Teachers,” thanking him for his influences. We wanted to invite him to sing with us because he makes emotional music. What\'s odd is that Romanthony and Todd Edwards are not big in the United States at all. Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions, the compression, the sound of the kick drum, and Romanthony\'s voice... The emotion and soul is part of how we sound today. Because they mean something to us, it was much more important for us to work with them than with other big stars. ”\n\nGiving his take on working with Romanthony and Edwards, Bangalter stated:\n“ We wanted to work with Romanthony and Todd Edwards on our first album. They didn\'t know who we were at the time, so it was very difficult to convince them. When we met Romanthony in Miami, he told us he was very into what we were doing, which made us very happy. They are the house producers who were the biggest influence on us. Working with them was a way for us to close the circle. It was very important for us to do that, because they are part of what we do. Now that we\'ve worked with them, we are free to explore other areas. It will be interesting to see what we\'ll do next. Now we can work with other people. ”\n\nDJ Sneak also discussed working with Daft Punk on the album:\n“ I went to Paris on one trip, got together with the boys and had a private party at the loft house where Thomas had just moved into  in a rare form of musical display we decided to make beats in front of a few guests. The next few days we continued to work on the music and I sat back and wrote the lyrics to ""Digital Love"". I had written other things but this song was very special from the get-go. I also co-produced the music and they polished it and finished a masterpiece. ”\n\nReception\n\nUpon release, critics noted the immediate style differences of Discovery from Homework. The change in aesthetic was a jarring move for fans of Daft Punk\'s earlier work and initially caused some critics to pan the album. Discovery gained praise in later years; the album ranked #12 in Pitchfork Media\'s Top 100 Albums of 2000–04 and #3 in their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s despite receiving an initial rating of 6.4. In 2009, Rhapsody ranked the album at #12 on its ""100 Best Albums of the Decade"" list. It was also named the 4th best album of the decade by Resident Advisor. Q rated the album five stars out of five, an unusual occurrence for the magazine. Regarding the album\'s structure, the magazine Spin noted that, ""It feels like a concept album -- in this case, the story of how wine-flow disco circumnavigated intellectual pretensions on all sides en route to a temporary utopia that may finally believe in nothing but the boogie but still has the infinite on its mind every minute."" NME referred to Discovery as ""audaciously weird"" and added: ""With its famously camera-shy creators now dressing as funkadelic Power Rangers, it is also something of a concept album.""\nThe album peaked at #2 in the United Kingdom and #44 in the United States. Discovery has sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005. The album was certified triple platinum in France (in 2007) for shipments denoting 600,000 copies. As a result of sales, Discovery was certified Gold by the RIAA as of October 11, 2010. Two cult hits were spawned from this album: ""One More Time"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". The song ""Face to Face"" (featuring Todd Edwards) reached #1 on the Billboard Club chart in 2004. The album was included on BBC Radio 1\'s Masterpieces in December 2009 presented by Zane Lowe, further highlighting the progression of the reception of the album and showing how highly regarded the album is amongst fans and fellow dance artists.\nSeveral songs from the album would later be sampled by other artists. Kanye West\'s song ""Stronger"" from the album Graduation features a vocal sample of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". ""Stronger"" was later performed live at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while Kanye West was on stage rapping. Wiley\'s song ""Summertime"" from the album See Clear Now features a sample of ""Aerodynamic"". Jazmine Sullivan\'s song ""Dream Big"" from the album Fearless features a sample of ""Veridis Quo"". On February 18, 2011, Trinity Orchestra played the first ever live full orchestral performance of Discovery at Trinity College. The filmed performance became the most watched YouTube video in Ireland on the day of its release.\n\nIt really is a very good album <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Discovery"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This week’s headliner, Sam Cooke, has not yet arrived, but the band (a mix of Sam Cooke’s regular accompanists guitar Clif White and drummer Albert “June” Gardner along with King Curtis and his band) have changed into their uniforms in the men’s room upstairs, and the RCA engineers are set up with eight mikes plugged into a three-track, twelve-position mixer in the little office that overlooks the dance floor. A Couple of times assistant engineer Tony Salvatore struggles through the crowd to check a lead or change a mike placement, barely able to find his way in the absence of any illumination except that provided by the cheap colored lights. At last the headliner arrives in a swirl of activity, changes swiftly into an open-necked shirt, greets the RCA crew with a “Hiya, fellas” and a casual wave, and starts down the stairs – where he encounters a six-inch scorpion. Not even breaking stride, he stomps on it and makes his way to the stage just as the MC finishes his introduction. “Right now, ladies and gentlemen, we’d like to get ready to introduce the star of our show, the young man you’ve all been waiting for, Mister Soul, so what d’you say let’s all get together and welcome him to the stand with a great big hand, how ‘bout it for Sam Cooke.”\n\n It’s Another Night On The Chitlin Circuit\n\nIt’s rare that an album can cause us to radically reassess a major artist, particularly one who has been dead for 20 years. This is such an album. Everyone has his or her own image of Sam Cooke. Hailed with Ray Charles as the father of gospel-based soul music, Cooke has always been perceived as the mellifluous side of the equation: smooth, urbane, possessed of one of the most liltingly graceful and swinging voices in the history of American pop music, the progenitor of “sweet” soul. He was, says Jerry Wrexler, who sought in vain to sign him to the Atlantic label, “the best singer who ever lived, no contest. When I listen to him, I still can’t believe the things that he did. It’s always fresh and amazing to me; he has control, he could play with his voice like an instrument, his melisma, which was his personal brand – I mean, nobody else could do it – everything about him was perfection. A perfect case.” His influence on a whole generation of singers – from Solomon Burke to Wilson Pickett to Bobby Womack, Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergress, Al Green and Aretha Franklin, to Rod Stewart and Steve Perry – has been universally acknowledged. His one previously released live recording, Sam Cooke at the Copa (done about a year and a half after the Harlem Square Club date), has stood as a classic of sophisticated soul for over two decades now, and he was certainly among the most popular artists in the world at the time of his death in 1964.\n\n What can this album add to our appreciation of Sam Cooke, then?\n\n It’s a different Sam Cooke. The Sam Cooke who appears on this record, presenting his R&B hits of the last years to a crowd that knows and loves his music, it not the same Sam Cooke who appeared on the Tonight Show, who presented himself as a kind of urbane “swinger”. The Sam Cooke who sang to this club audience made up of working men and women is a harder, grittier version of the Sam Cooke that we have known from his records, a singer closer to the ecstatic gospel music with which he started out, the very entertainer that black audiences could see every night of the week in Charlotte, Roanoke, Raleigh, Baton Rouge, crisscrossing the South with one of Henry Wynn’s SuperSonic Attractions package tours, battling it out with Jackie Wilson at clubs like the Harlem Square in nightly Battles of the Blues. “That’s Sam,” says veteran black music promotion woman Rowena Harris, who first heard Sam with the Soul Stirrers in her native Birmingham, Alabama. “That’s the real Sam Cooke. That’s what he was like.” “When he was really in his bag,” says J.W. Alexander, Cooke’s longtime friend and business partner, “you know, when he was really having fun, he could work, he could drive the women into a frenzy. It was almost like a sex act, like he was beating up on them to get an orgasm.” That is what you get on this album, too, an audience that is frenzied a part of the show itself, a sense on the part of the entertainment that he can do what he wants with them, that he is home free.\n\n The first, a “teen-age matinee,” serves as a sound check, giving the band a chance to acclimate a itself and the engineers one last opportunity to get their mike placement right. By the time the second set starts they wouldn’t be able to change anything if they wanted to, because the club is jammed well beyond its 750 capacity, the floor so crowded around the bandstand you can no longer squeeze your way through. The program is identical each set. All the songs are familiar, none dating back much more than a couple of years with the exception of “You Send Me,” a No. 1 pop hit in 1957, and the familiar pop standard, “(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons,” which Cooke also recorded for Keen before signing with RCA.\n\n At the same time none of the songs bear more than a passing resemblance to the antiseptic treatment in the hit version. “You Send Me,” for example, perhaps Cooke’s most evanescent celebration of romantic love on record, is transformed here into a white-hot interlude of almost savage intensity that serves as an intro to “Bring It On Home To Me,” one of his most explicitly gospel-derived numbers. The segment from “You Send Me” on is in fact the conclusion to the 15-minute set that Sam presents on the package shows, a sharp flickering of feeling in which perfect musicality is sacrificed to a less-controlled sensibility, in which the voice is frayed but the emotion true. By the third set all pretense of subtlety is lost, the mask of the genial host is abandoned for the chuckle of complicity, and there is something irremediably nasty in it all, something evil, something soul-stirring, something beautiful. It is as Ray Charles says: “When I do a song, I must be able to make it stink in my own way.” Except for the lyrics, this is a performance that could have been lifted from a Soul Stirrers show, when Sam Cooke was the No. 1 attraction in gospel music.\n\n Sam Cook was born without the “e” in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931 and grew up in Chicago, singing gospel with the Highway QC’s, a kind of junior division of the Soul Stirrers, the most celebrated gospel quartet of the day. That was how J.W. Alexander, 30-year-old tenor singer and manager of the Pilgrim Travelers, a group almost equally renowned, first laid eyes on Cooke at the age of 16 or 17. “He didn’t really have the delivery,” says Alexander, a dignified, well-spoken man with a shock of white hair and a warm infectious charm of his own. “People just liked the guy. I thought to myself, ‘This guy’s a jewel.’”\n\n Art Rupe, President of Specialty Records (to which the Soul Stirrers were signed), remembered first meeting the 20-year-old singer in February 1951 after Stirrers lead vocalist (and Cooke’s previous chief stylistic influence) R.H. Harris quit the group in the fall. “Sam was just a boy when he came here with manager Roy Crain; they were afraid I wouldn’t accept him because we were accustomed to Rebert Harris. We took a chance and he made a hit right away.” Despite a certain stiffness at the beginning, Cooke soon demonstrated his special charisma and rapidly took on a kind of matinee-idol status within the world of gospel. Disarmingly handsome, almost breathtakingly at ease with himself and his charm, he possessed the rare ability to suggest swinging without effort, passion without strain, a sense of clarity and simplicity that gave him a direct line to his audience while preserving his star insouciance. By 1955-56 his records with the Soul Stirrers had achieved a unique limpidity and grace, and indeed along with this album and a handful of the pop sides they continue to stand as the essential Sam Cooke, the definition of feeling that soul is supposed to be all about. When, after the success of Ray Charles, all kinds of singers began crossing over from gospel to pop, translating the old gospel standards, as Charles had done, into unashamedly secular settings, Cooke was torn, put out one record under the pseudonym of Dale Cook, and eventually declared himself a pop singer. His first release under his own name, on the fledgling Keen label, was “You Send Me.”\n\n He had hits over the years both with standards and, more often, with original compositions that conformed to his own definition that “a song should have a lilting melody and be easily remembered. I use phrases say every day. A repetitious phrase helps put the story across.” In late 1958, J.W. persuaded Sam to join him in a publishing company (Kags) and, the following year, in a brand-new record label (SAR), which, as writer Joe McEwen has pointed out, subsequently served as an outlet for Sam that did not find expression on the RCA material. The Sims Twins, for example, forerunners of Sam and Dave, recorded “That’s Where It’s At” almost two years before Sam did. Johnnie “Two Voice” Morisette did the same thing with “Meet Me At The Twistin’ Place,” and Johnnie Taylor cut a beautiful early version of “Rome Wasn’t Built In A Day.” Overall the sides that were cut for SAR were harsher, more down-to-earth, less “pale” than the more pop-oriented RCA arrangements, despite the presence of much the same personnel and the contributions of long-time arranger René Hall on both sets of sessions. It was only during the last year and a half of his life – perhabs emboldened by the growing success of both his label and career, and in the wend with a new manager, Allen Klein, and a renegotiated contract that guaranteed him artistic control – that Cooke began recording some of this material himself. In fact his greatest composition, “A Change Is Gonna Come,” a self-proclaimed “civil rights song” that was inspired by Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind,” was released on an album (Ain’t That Good News) in early 1964 but came out only posthumously as a single – and then with one overtly explicit verse excised. His death in December 1964 (he was shot by the night manager of a $33-a-night Los Angeles motel_ came to symbolize the impossible contradictions between black aspirations and reality. As sordid and senseless as his own demise may have looked, it took on a mythology of its own, a mythology in which Sam Cooke was cut down for his independence, for his overweening ambition, for his “uppity” nature. It was said that over 100,000 people viewed his body as it lay in state in ceremonies in both Chicago and Los Angeles, and Ray Charles sang “Angels Keep Watching Over Me” at the Los Angeles funeral.\n\n Removed by 20 years, what do we hear on this record? We hear a voice that’s at once both familiar and fresh, but one that’s never before been captured in this setting. We see a disguise lifted off, a reality acknowledged. This is the real world of Sam Cooke and every other black R&B singer, this is the secret of race, this is the unbuttoned reality. When you hear Sam Cooke sing of going to the but station with a cardboard suitcase in his hand and then ask, “Can you imagine me carrying one of them suitcases?,” for the first time we can. We can, and we can’t. There’s both venomousness and warmth, identification and incredulity in the formulation of the question. “Let me tell you what I’m doing, baby,” the singer teases his audience with warmhearted good humor as he plays with one of the oldest lines from the blues, then declares, “I’m standing here wondering, will a cotton-picking matchbox hold my clothes?”\n\n Try not singing along with “Bring It On Home To Me.” Try not to be swept up by “Nothing Can Change This Love,” as in the midst of a Reaganesque picture of romantic love (“You’re the apple of my eye/You’re cherry pie/You’re cake and ice cream”), he declares with an urgency that belies the lyrics, “Let me hear the middle part one more time; give me that middle part one more time.” And in the end put yourself in the same position as the audience at the Harlem Square Club, imagine yourself going out into the Miami night with Sam’s final admonition still ringing in your ears: “Keep on having that party.” As soul DJ, the Magnificent Montague, recited to his audience at the conclusion of a bantering interview with Cooke on the subjects of soul, survival, philosophy and poetics: “And when the humming’s over / And time finds its soul / All I can say to you, darlings / Sam Cooke’s yours / He’ll never grow old.”\n\n-         Peter Guralnick, December, 1984\n\n\n  P O S T S C R I P T\n\n When I wrote these notes over twenty years ago, there were a number of things I didn’t know – and probably couldn’t have understood anyway without a lot of additional context. One was how recently Sm had adopted the act he showcased at the Harlem Square. He had toured England in October of 1962 with Little Richard, the self-styled wildman of rock ‘n’ roll, who was returning to the secular stage for the first time in five years. Night after night Richard took the show with what Sam’s friend and business partner, J.W. Alexander, called that he needed to develop a new act to reflect the gospel fervor in his own music. He debuted the act at the Apollo the week of November 2, and this was the set that he presented at the Harlem Square just two months later.\n\n There were a number of ancillary issues it was difficult to grasp at the time. What prompted the recording of the show in the first place (probably a combination of James Brown paying to record his own live show at the Apollo two weeks prior to Sam’s opening there and Sam’s justifiable pride in his new act). Why the album was not released contemporaneously (a growing backlog of studio recordings by Sam, including his brilliant Night Beat album, together with the usual music business split between music and business). I had no idea that the Harlem Square date was part of a month-long tour with King Curtis, which in turn led to another month out in March and then a seven-week all-star tour under the Supersonic Attractions banner with Solomon Burke, Jerry Butler, the Drifters, Dionne Warwick, Gorgeous George, and Lotsa Poppa among others. I was unaware of the full extent of the ferment of creative activity in which Sam was caught up at the time.\n\n  One thing I did know: I wanted to write a biography of Sam Cooke. I had known that ever since meeting J.W. Alexander in 1982, when the picture he painted of Sam, the portrait he had painstakingly drawn of Sam’s boundless charm, adventurousness, and ambition, was every bit as enticing as the music itself.\n\n It took me a while to get around to the biography, and over the years that I researched and wrote the book, I was able to answer some questions about the Harlem Square, while others inevitable remained a mystery. The one unchangeable element was the impact of the music itself, the way it held sway not just over it’s audience but over its creator, the almost hypnotic effect it continues to exert over new listeners to this day. For anyone who saw these shows while they were still crisscrossing the country in Supersonic packages and Summer Showers of Stars, the power of the performance will come as little surprise, but like James Brown Live At The Apollo, Sam Cooke Live At The Harlem Square stands as one of the few recorded monuments to an era in which the good feeling of the audience was as important as the showmanship of the performer. Out on the chitlin circuit charm, wit, and challenge mixed with grace and transcendence to create a real sense of community, the sense that things were getting better, if only, as Sam suggested in “That’s Where It’s At,” one of his most poignant compositions (“Your heart beating fast/You’re knowing that time will pass/But hoping that it’ll last/That’s where it’s at”), for the fleeting moment that was being shared.\n\n \n-     Peter Guralnick, July 2005\n\n\n\n\n “Live At Harlem Square” is one of my favorite live recordings of all time. It captures the true energy of this staggering, passionate talent. It’s such an intimate recording – you can hear cracks in his voice, the madness of the crowd who are so with him, encouraging him, shouting for him in each song. A particular favorite is “Twistin’ The Night Away.” Sam Cooke will always be a tremendous influence on me, and who knows, if there weren’t a Sam, there might not have been a Rod.”                          \n\n - Rod Stewart, June 23, 2005. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cooke/Live+At+The+Harlem+Square+Club,+1963"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The songs on Blue Lines run at \'spliff\' tempos - from a mellow, moonwalking 90 beats per minute ...down to a positively torpid 67 bpm."" The group also drew inspiration from concept albums in various genres by artists such as Pink Floyd, Public Image Ltd., Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.\n\nBlue Lines featured breakbeats, sampling, and rapping on a number of tracks, but the design of the album differed from traditional hip hop. Massive Attack approached the American-born hip hop movement from an underground British perspective, as well as incorporating live instruments into the mixes. It features the vocals of Shara Nelson and Horace Andy, along with the rapping of Tricky Kid. Blue Lines proved to be popular in the club scene, as well as on college radios.\n\nDaddy G said about the making of the album: ""We were lazy Bristol twats. It was Neneh Cherry who kicked our arses and got us in the studio. We recorded a lot at her house, in her baby\'s room. It stank for months and eventually we found a dirty nappy behind a radiator. I was still DJing, but what we were trying to do was create dance music for the head, rather than the feet. I think it\'s our freshest album, we were at our strongest then.""\n\nIn 1997, Blue Lines was named the 21st ""greatest album of all time"" in a ""Music of the Millennium"" poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q readers placed it at number 58 in its list of the ""100 Greatest Albums Ever"", and in 2000, the album was voted at number 9 in the magazine\'s poll of the ""100 Greatest British Albums Ever"". In 2003, the album was ranked number 395 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nStuart Bailie of BBC Northern Ireland stated that, ""It was soul music. But it had bold, symphonic arrangements. It featured samples of the Mahavishnu Orchestra going \'hey, hey hey, hey.\' It had funky breaks and an emotional power that was hard to figure. It sounded anxious and lost. But there was a grandeur in the music also. People who came across the record became obsessed, spinning it endlessly.""\n\nThe track ""Unfinished Sympathy"" has received high accolades, frequently described as one of the best songs of all time. It was nominated for a BRIT Award as best single of 1991. It also appeared on the soundtrack for the 1993 Sharon Stone film Sliver. According to BBC.co.uk: ""More than a decade after its release it remains one of the most moving pieces of dance music ever, able to soften hearts and excite minds just as keenly as a ballad by Bacharach or a melody by McCartney."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/Blue+Lines"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album\'s title refers to Atlantic\'s request that the band produce an album ""loaded with hits"". Doug Yule said, ""On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like this is sort of a Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/Loaded"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Suddenly I had confidence which I\'d never ever had in my life,"" Fraser said, ""which I consequently lost after I had the baby, because it\'s such a frightening experience you lose it again and you have to start over again. But it does change you."".\n\nGuitarist Robin Guthrie was experiencing problems with drug addiction. As a result of his decreased time in the studio, bassist Simon Raymonde\'s playing was more in the forefront.\n\n""We\'ve had it in the back of our mind that we wanted to play live again,"" said Guthrie at the time of the album\'s release, ""so we thought we\'d make some of the pieces more like songs we could actually play live… We like it better than all our last records. That\'s why we continue to make more – because if we made the perfect record we\'d sit back and say, \'We can\'t do any better than that.\' We think all our other ones are fucking crap. I\'m slightly proud of a couple of tracks on a couple of them, but essentially I\'m really embarrassed about what we\'ve done in the past…"".\n\nThe album has received positive critical acclaim. ""Heaven or Las Vegas is their finest hour yet,"" enthused Martin Aston in Q. ""Ten exquisite moments that make Kate Bush – their only possible comparison – sound as airborne as Motörhead."" The album subsequently featured in the magazine\'s ""best of the year"" roundup: ""The Cocteaus continue on their inimitable course, blissfully regardless of what\'s going on in the world outside their surreal reality.""\n\n""You may be able to dig out some of the words,"" wrote Andrew Perry in Select, ""you may even get to hear some of the songs live, but Heaven Or Las Vegas is Cocteau Twins in their usual, spectacular and enigmatic context."" ""In times when every other pop group is dragging on board whatever chemicals, \'60s techniques and hypno-rhythms they can grab in order to achieve the desirable blissed-out condition,"" said Roger Morton in Vox, ""it\'s a good joke that the Cocteaus can get there with such apparent effortlessness.""\'\n\nIt was listed as the 90th best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media, who complimented Fraser\'s more direct vocals and the album\'s complex songwriting. The album was also included in the 2008 edition of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and in The Guardian\'s online edition of a similar list. It was considered the band\'s strongest work since Treasure by AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett, who described it as ""simply fantastic"" and successful in creating ""more accessibility"".\n\nHeaven or Las Vegas was named by NME as the 28th best album of 1990. Retrospectively, The Observer listed the album as the 97th greatest British album ever made. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins/Heaven+or+Las+Vegas"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was co-produced with longterm collaborator Rob Cavallo and released on September 21, 2004 through Reprise Records.\n\nIn mid-2003, the band began recording songs for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines. However, the master tracks were lost and the band decided to start over rather than re-record Cigarettes and Valentines. They decided to produce a rock opera, inspired by the work of The Who and numerous musicals. It follows the life of ""Jesus of Suburbia"", a sort of anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. Following early recording at Oakland, California\'s Studio 880, the band finished the album in Los Angeles.\n\nThe album achieved popularity worldwide, charting in 26 countries and reaching number one in nineteen of them, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Since its release, American Idiot has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, including 267,000 in its opening week. The album won numerous awards including a Grammy for Best Rock Album, and was generally well received by critics.\n\nIn mid-2003, Green Day convened at Studio 880 in Oakland, California, and recorded about 20 songs for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines. However, the master tracks went missing. The band, wondering if it should re-record the songs, consulted with producer Rob Cavallo over what to do. Cavallo told the band members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented their best work. Guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said the band members ""couldn\'t honestly look at ourselves and say, \'That was the best thing we\'ve ever done.\' So we decided to move on and do something completely new."" The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.\n\nThe first new song Green Day wrote was ""American Idiot"". The band had difficulty following it up. One day, bassist Mike Dirnt was in the studio recording a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided he wanted to do the same, and drummer Tré Cool followed suit. Armstrong recalled, ""It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits until we had something."" This musical suite became ""Homecoming"", and the band subsequently wrote another suite, ""Jesus of Suburbia"". Armstrong was so emboldened by the creation of the two suites that he decided to make the record an album-long conceptual piece. The band took inspiration from concept records by The Who, as well as musicals including West Side Story and Jesus Christ Superstar. During their sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional crank calls.\n\nWith demos completed, Green Day relocated to Los Angeles to continue work on the album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Armstrong said, ""As a songwriter, I get so deep into what I\'m writing about, it\'s almost like I have to stir up shit to write about it."" The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment, ""For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how we were supposed to behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we\'re rock stars.""\n\nAmerican Idiot is a concept album that tells the story of a central character named Jesus of Suburbia. The album was a departure from Green Day\'s typical way of writing music. Armstrong said, ""As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge  structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules."" Armstrong said the band aimed to be ambitious, which he felt many contemporary rock bands were not.\n\nThe band favored loud guitar sounds for the record; Armstrong said ""we were like, \'Let\'s just go balls-out on the guitar sound--plug in the Les Pauls and Marshalls and let it rip\'"". The guitarist played more lead guitar on the album than he had on any previous release, which he said he previously shied away from for fear of sounding ""corny"". Armstrong added tracks of acoustic guitar-playing throughout the record to augment his electric guitar rhythms and Cool\'s drumming, creating a percussive sound.\n\nThe album\'s protagonist, Jesus of Suburbia, emerged out of Armstrong asking himself what sort of person the title of ""American Idiot"" referred to. Armstrong described the character as essentially an anti-hero, a powerless ""everyman"" desensitized by a ""steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin"". Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. As the album progresses the characters St. Jimmy and Whatsername are introduced. St. Jimmy is a punk rock freedom fighter. Whatsername, inspired by the Bikini Kill song ""Rebel Girl"", is a ""Mother Revolution"" figure that Armstrong described as ""kind of St. Jimmy\'s nemesis in a lot of ways"". Both characters illustrate the ""rage vs. love"" theme of the album, in that ""you can go with the blind rebellion of self-destruction, where Saint Jimmy is. But there\'s a more love-driven side to that, which is following your beliefs and ethics. And that\'s where Jesus of Suburbia really wants to go"", according to Armstrong. Near the end of the story, St. Jimmy apparently commits suicide. While the singer did not want to give away the details of the story\'s resolution, he said the intention is for the listener to ultimately realize that Jesus of Suburbia is really St. Jimmy, and Jimmy is ""part of the main character that pretty much dies"". In the album final song, ""Whatsername"", Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well.\n\nUpon American Idiot\'s release in September 2004, American Idiot peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. It achieved five times platinum status in the United States, eight times platinum status in Canada and six times platinum status in the United Kingdom. Five singles were released in support of the album, all of which charted on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" topped both the Mainstream and the Modern Rock charts. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television.\n\nAllmusic praised the album from both perspectives; either as ""a collection of great songs"", or as a whole. Pitchfork Media said the ""ambitious"" album was successful in getting across its message, and ""keeps its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and angrily on point"". Uncut wrote that although the album was heavily politically focused, ""slam-dancing is still possible"", in a moderate review, while The New York Times praised Green Day for trumping ""any pretension with melody and sheer fervor"".\n\nEntertainment Weekly said that despite being based on a musical theater concept ""that periodically makes no sense"", Green Day ""make the journey entertaining enough"". It described most of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music. Robert Christgau\'s C+ said the album featured ""emotional travails of two clueless punks"" using ""devices that sunk under their own weight back when The Who invented them"", and The Guardian called American Idiot a mess—""but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess"". Rolling Stone said the album could have been, and was, a mess, but that the ""individual tunes are tough and punchy enough to work on their own"".\n\nIn 2005, American Idiot won a Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated in four other categories including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards they were nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" video won six of those awards. A year later, ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" won a Grammy for Record of the Year. It was named The number 1 album of the Century by Kerrang in 2009.\n\nA musical adaption of the album was created and released in 2009, American Idiot premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre on September 4 2009. It was initially intended to run through October 11, but before the premiere, the theatre announced a three week extension. The new closing date is November 1. The musical is a collaboration between Green Day and Michael Mayer (Tony Award winning director of Spring Awakening). Green Day does not appear in the production, but the show has got an onstage band. The cast features Tony award winner John Gallagher Jr. (Spring Awakening) as Johnny, Michael Esper (A Man for All Seasons) as Will, Tony Vincent (Jesus Christ Superstar) as St Jimmy, Rebecca Naomi Jones as Whatsername, Mary Faber as Heather, along with 14 other actors.

Now there was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered; a connection to the earth....I was beginning to feel that we (the sextet) were playing this heavy kind of music, and I was tired of everything being heavy. I wanted to play something lighter."" (Hancock\'s sleeve notes: 1997 CD reissue)\n\nFor the new album, Hancock assembled a new band, The Headhunters, of whom only Bennie Maupin had been a sextet member. Hancock handled all synthesizer parts himself (having previously shared these duties with Patrick Gleeson) and he decided against the use of guitar altogether, favouring instead the clavinet, one of the defining sounds on the album. The new band featured a tight rhythm and blues-oriented rhythm section, and the album has a relaxed, funky groove that gave the album an appeal to a far wider audience. Perhaps the defining moment of the jazz-fusion movement (or perhaps even the spearhead of the Jazz-funk style of the fusion genre), the album made jazz listeners out of rhythm and blues fans, and vice versa. The album mixes funk rhythms, like the busy high hats in 16th notes on the opening track ""Chameleon"", with the jazz AABA form and extended soloing.\n\nOf the four tracks on the album ""Watermelon Man"" was the only one not written for the album. A hit from Hancock\'s hard bop days, originally appearing on his first album Takin\' Off, it was reworked by Hancock and Mason and has an instantly recognisable intro featuring Bill Summers blowing into a beer bottle, an imitation of the hindewho, an instrument of the Mbuti Pygmies of Northeastern Zaire. The track features heavy use of African percussion. ""Sly"" was dedicated to pioneering funk musician Sly Stone, leader of Sly & the Family Stone. ""Chameleon"" (the opening track) is another track with an instantly recognisable intro, the very funky bassline being played on an ARP Odyssey synth. ""Vein Melter"" is a slow-burner, predominantly featuring Hancock and Maupin, with Hancock mostly playing Fender Rhodes electric piano, but occasionally bringing in some heavily effected synth parts.\n\nHeavily edited versions of ""Chameleon"" and ""Vein Melter"" were released as a 45 rpm single.\n\nAfter its initial release, the album was also mixed into Quadraphonic (4-channel sound) and released by Columbia in 1974 in the vinyl and 8-track tape formats. The quad mixes features audio elements not heard in the stereo version, including a 2-second keyboard melody at the beginning of ""Sly"" that was edited out. It was released digitally on the hybrid SACD edition for the album (Columbia/Legacy CS 65123).\n\nAt the time of the 1992 CD reissue it was the largest-selling jazz album of all time, and has been an inspiration not only for jazz musicians, but also to funk, soul music, jazz funk and hip hop artists.\n\nThe HeadHunters band worked with Hancock on a number of other albums, including Thrust (1974), Man-Child (1975), Flood (recorded live in Japan, 1975), Secrets (1976) and Sunlight (1977), and themselves produced a couple of fine funk albums, Survival of the Fittest (1975) and Straight from the Gate (1978), the first of which was produced by Hancock and featured the big hit ""God Make me Funky"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/Head+Hunters"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, holding that spot for nine weeks. It has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\n\nAll nine tracks that she sings on were personally approved and arranged by Joplin. Joplin sang on all tracks except Buried Alive in the Blues, which was actually a backing track in which she had not yet recorded vocals. The song\'s writer Nick Gravenites was offered the opportunity to sing it as a tribute to Joplin, but he turned it down, and as a result, the song ended up as an instrumental. The recording sessions, starting in early September, ended with Joplin\'s untimely death on October 4, 1970. Her final session, which took place on Thursday, October 1 after a break of several days, yielded her a cappella Mercedes Benz.

Check Your Head was recorded at the G-Son Studios in Atwater Village, California in 1991. The album features the popular hits ""So Whatcha Want"" and ""Pass the Mic""; the music videos for both songs are available on the Criterion Collection Beastie Boys Video Anthology DVD set. The album was re-released in 2009 in a number of formats and featured 16 b-sides and rarities as well as a commentary track. The album is extensively broken down track-by-track by Mike D, MCA, Ad-Rock, Mario Caldato Jr., and Money Mark in Brian Coleman\'s book Check the Technique.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nIn contrast to their previous album, Paul\'s Boutique, the Boys returned stylistically to their punk rock roots on Check Your Head, playing their own instruments for the first time on record since their early EPs (although they did provide live instrumentation on at least two songs on Paul\'s Boutique). Hence photographer Glen E. Friedman\'s idea to shoot photos with their instrument cases (one of which became the cover). The cover itself is a subtle depiction of the famous Three Wise Monkeys: ""See No Evil,"" ""Hear No Evil,"" and ""Speak No Evil."" (This theme is revisited in the lyrics of ""Finger Lickin\' Good."") The album was their first to be fully co-produced by Mario Caldato Jr. Caldato was an engineer on Paul\'s Boutique and was credited as producer on that album\'s track ""Ask for Janice"". The album also marks the first appearance of long time collaborator keyboardist Money Mark.\n\nThere\'s been some debate about the Dutch band Urban Dance Squad, who had toured the United States with Living Colour in early 1991, influencing the Beastie Boys to play live instruments again; as the Beastie\'s earlier hardcore style bears little resemblance to the style they play on Check Your Head. The Urban Dance Squad album, Life \'n Perspectives of a Genuine Crossover, was recorded at ICP, Brussels, in the spring of 1991 and released in the autumn; while the Beastie Boys recorded Check Your Head throughout 1991 and released it in spring 1992.

The decoder for the code was featured prominently on the back cover of the album and can also be used for the ""Blue Monday"" and ""Confusion"" singles. Saville also used it on Section 25\'s album From the Hip, which is in many ways aligned stylistically with Power, Corruption & Lies and produced partly by New Order\'s Bernard Sumner.\n\nThe cover is a reproduction of the painting ""A Basket of Roses"" by French artist Henri Fantin-Latour, which is part of the National Gallery of London\'s permanent collection. The art director Peter Saville intended to create a collision between the overly romantic and classic image which made a stark contrast to the typography based on the modular, colour-coded alphabet he created solely for the band. It is also said that the owner of the painting (The National Heritage Trust) first refused Factory Records access to it. Tony Wilson, the head of the label, then called them up to ask who actually owned the painting and were given the answer that the Trust belonged to the people of Britain, at some point. Wilson then famously replied ""Well, the people of Britain now want it"". The title of the album was chosen by Bernard Sumner from a 1981 conceptual art exhibition in Cologne, Germany. On the opening night of the exhibition the artist Gerhard Richter vandalized the exterior of the Kunsthalle by spray painting the text, ""Power, Corruption, and Lies"" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/Power,+Corruption+&+Lies"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During tour rehearsals for the previous year\'s French summer tour, David Gilmour came up with the signature 4-note theme and the piece took shape from there. With the memory of former front-man/singer-songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett fresh in his mind, Roger Waters wrote the lyrics as a tribute to his fallen friend, at the time already an reclusive figure.\n\nIn 1974, it would be performed as one uninterrupted piece. However, during the band\'s tour of North America the following year, it would be split in two parts, sandwiching another new song, ""Have a Cigar"". A funky guitar-driven piece, it would ultimately be sung on the final recorded version by Roy Harper, as Roger\'s voice was in poor shape. This song, and the ominous ""Welcome to the Machine"" were written reflecting the band\'s negative attitude towards the record industry. They also (with various instrumental parts of ""Shine On"") feature synthesizers in a stronger fashion than previous albums, as well as the sound effects (provided by Nick Mason) that are signature to the Floyd sound.\n\nThe title track took shape when Gilmour came to the studio and showed the band the chord sequence, which suitably impressed Waters. He then wrote the lyrics, referring to Syd Barrett\'s departure and Roger\'s own growing alienation from his band and from other people (these themes later on would become essential to his story of The Wall). More than any previous Floyd number, it has a very prominent Country & Western feel to the instrumentation (pedal steel guitar and acoustic piano) and the melancholy feel to the lyrics. It would eventually become one of the band\'s signature songs, and is as of now (May of 2009) the band\'s most scrobbled song on Last.fm.\n\nTowards the end of the recording process, a stranger who at first looked unfamiliar to the band and the engineers appeared in the studio. After much discussion of who it was, the band slowly recognized him as the man whose story and personal relationship with the group had heavily influenced the record, Syd Barrett. Each member was unsure of what song they were mixing, but urban legend has it that it was ""Shine On"", which adds a new and deep personal resonance to the already emotional piece. Subsequently Syd disappeared from sight, as the band members attended David Gilmour\'s wedding ceremony that night. That was the last time any member of Pink Floyd had personal contact with their former enigmatic leader.\n\nThe record was released in the Fall of 1975, the band\'s first on Columbia Records (in the United States, EMI was and remained the Floyd\'s International label). It became the fastest selling record of their career, topping both the American (certified Gold within two days of it\'s release and ultimately 6X Multi-Platinum in May 1997 by the R.I.A.A.) and U.K. album charts (Gold within the year, but has yet to achieve Platinum status).\n\nThe band themselves hold the album in high artistic regard, despite the negative and disconnected environment during recording, with both Gilmour and Rick Wright saying it was their favorite. It was the last of their albums in which Rick played an important role in composing the music (making significant keyboard contributions on ""Shine On""), until nearly 20 years later with The Division Bell. On the band\'s next three albums, the lions share of the song-writing credit would go to Roger Waters. This, in part with the deteriorating relationship between the band, would cause Roger to leave in 1985, ten years after Wish You Were Here.\n\nTracklist\n1.

Several songs on Double Nickels on the Dime were outsourced to or inspired by contemporaries, such as Black Flag\'s Henry Rollins and Jack Brewer of Saccharine Trust.\nDouble Nickels on the Dime is seen not only as Minutemen\'s crowning achievement, but, as critic Mark Deming notes, ""one of the very best American rock albums of the 1980s."" The album now appears on many professional lists of the all-time best rock albums, including Rolling Stone\' s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Recorded without the input of either Nico or Andy Warhol, White Light/White Heat was the purest and rawest document of the key Velvets lineup of Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Maureen Tucker, capturing the group at their toughest and most abrasive. The album opens with an open and enthusiastic endorsement of amphetamines (startling even from this group of noted drug enthusiasts), and side one continues with an amusing shaggy-dog story set to a slab of lurching mutant R&B (""The Gift""), a perverse variation on an old folktale (""Lady Godiva\'s Operation""), and the album\'s sole ""pretty"" song, the mildly disquieting ""Here She Comes Now."" While side one was a good bit darker in tone than the Velvets\' first album, side two was where they truly threw down the gauntlet with the manic, free-jazz implosion of ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" (featuring Reed\'s guitar work at its most gloriously fractured), and the epic noise jam ""Sister Ray,"" 17 minutes of sex, drugs, violence, and other non-wholesome fun with the loudest rock group in the history of Western Civilization as the house band. White Light/White Heat is easily the least accessible of The Velvet Underground\'s studio albums, but anyone wanting to hear their guitar-mauling tribal frenzy straight with no chaser will love it, and those benighted souls who think of the Velvets as some sort of folk-rock band are advised to crank their stereo up to ten and give side two a spin. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/White+Light%2FWhite+Heat"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The lyrical matter deals with Marxist politics and sociological critiques that reflected the band\'s own postmodern political bent. Many modern punk bands are certainly indebted to the sonic work this band did long ago, and this record is often cited as a touchstone influence. In fact, direct sonic followers The Futureheads employed Gang of Four\'s guitarist on this album (and others), the inimitable Andy Gill, to produce their studio LPs.

Though Gram Parsons had joined the band as a pianist and lead guitarist, his deep love of C&W soon took hold, and Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman followed his lead; significantly, the only two original songs on the album were both written by Parsons (the achingly beautiful ""Hickory Wind"" and ""One Hundred Years from Now""), while on the rest of the set classic tunes by Merle Haggard, the Louvin Brothers, and Woody Guthrie were sandwiched between a pair of twanged-up Bob Dylan compositions. While many cite this as more of a Gram Parsons album than a Byrds set, given the strong country influence of McGuinn\'s and Hillman\'s later work, it\'s obvious Parsons didn\'t impose a style upon this band so much as he tapped into a sound that was already there, waiting to be released. If the Byrds didn\'t do country-rock first, they did it brilliantly, and few albums in the style are as beautiful and emotionally affecting as this. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Byrds/Sweetheart+Of+The+Rodeo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album contains singles ""High and Dry"", ""Fake Plastic Trees"", ""Just"", ""My Iron Lung"", and ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"".\n\nThe Bends was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 2 on Q\'s 100 Greatest Albums Ever.\n\nThe album was subject to much greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single ""Creep"" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.\n\nAccording to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke\'s songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band\'s later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs ""Fake Plastic Trees"" and, in particular, ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" and its b-side ""Talk Show Host"", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997). ""Fake Plastic Trees"" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while ""Sulk"" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke, ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.\n\nThe lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of ""My Iron Lung"", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke\'s alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next ""rock \'n roll martyr"" or suicide.\n\nThe Bends was the first of the band\'s full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name ""The White Chocolate Farm"" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical dummy with Yorke\'s own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.\n\nThe Bends met with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead\'s role as a standard-bearer of ""indie"" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height of the \'90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music; however, in the band\'s home country, Radiohead\'s music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called ""Britpop"" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.\n\nIn the United States, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single ""High and Dry"" reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.\n\nThe Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of ""the 50 albums that changed music"", saying, ""Radiohead\'s Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis\'s Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt."" Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid \'90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.\n\nThe Bends took second place behind Radiohead\'s OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2000, Virgin\'s Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is also the first of three albums to be completely original, the first four albums featuring at least one cover. The other two albums are Presence and In Through the Out Door.\n\nAlthough Houses of the Holy initially received mixed reviews, it has since become regarded by critics as one of Led Zeppelin\'s finest albums. The album provided notable additions to the band\'s catalogue, including ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""Dancing Days"", ""The Song Remains the Same"", ""D\'yer Mak\'er"", ""No Quarter"" and ""The Ocean"", and it has sold over 11 million copies in the United States. In 2003, the album was ranked number 149 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThis album was a stylistic turning point in the lifespan of Led Zeppelin. Guitar riffs became more layered within Jimmy Page\'s production techniques and departed from the blues influences of earlier records. In the album\'s opening opus, ""The Song Remains the Same"", and its intricate companion suite, ""The Rain Song"", Robert Plant\'s lyrics matured toward a less overt form of the mysticism and fantasy of previous efforts. \n\nHouses of the Holy also featured styles not heard on the first four Led Zeppelin albums. For example, ""D\'yer Mak\'er"" is a reggae-based tune; ""No Quarter"" features atmospheric keyboard sounds and an acoustic piano solo from John Paul Jones; ""The Crunge"" is a funk tribute to James Brown; and ""The Rain Song"" is embellished by Jones on his newly-acquired mellotron. The album\'s closing song ""The Ocean"", which featues an a cappella section and a doo-wop influenced coda, is dedicated to ""the ocean"" of fans who at this point of the band\'s career massed to Led Zeppelin concerts. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Houses+of+the+Holy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the most successful posthumous Nirvana release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with. MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: ""Something in the Way"" and ""Oh, Me."" The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996. The performance received a DVD release in 2007. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/MTV+Unplugged+in+New+York"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be his debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until he signed with Eminem\'s Shady Records in 2002.\n\nReleased a week in advance to combat bootlegging and internet leakage, Get Rich or Die Tryin\' debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album\'s singles also saw commercial success, with both ""In da Club"" and ""21 Questions"" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while ""P.I.M.P."" became a number one hit in several countries. The album was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End 2003 and received generally positive reviews from music critics.\n\nGet Rich or Die Tryin\' was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2000s. In 2020, it was certified 9× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the best-selling album of 2003 in the US, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at 2003 American Music Awards and Top Billboard 200 Album at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nPrior to the release of his mix-tape, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York on May 24, 2000. He managed to survive, but was dropped from his label, Columbia Records, and remained unsigned and in need of producing new music. In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cent\'s Guess Who\'s Back? mix-tape album through Jackson\'s attorney, who was working with Eminem\'s manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where he was introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one million dollar record deal with Dr. Dre and released his next mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured the 8 Mile single, ""Wanksta"", which was later put on Get Rich or Die Tryin\'. Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started working-productions on his debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL among others.\n\nThe first single ""In da Club"" was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on a couple songs, such as ""Patiently Waiting"" and ""Don\'t Push Me"". His songs also featured rappers within G-Unit, such as Lloyd Banks (""Don\'t Push Me""), Tony Yayo (""Like My Style""), or Young Buck (""Blood Hound""). The next single ""21 Questions"" was not in line to be on the album to Dr. Dre, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, ""Dre was, like, \'How you goin\' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?\'"" 50 Cent responded saying, ""I\'m two people. I\'ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that\'s not diversity, it\'s necessity."" ""Back Down"" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim\'s debut Aftermath album, Oh My God, but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of Get Rich or Die Tryin\' included a limited edition bonus DVD. A music video for ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" was made. The song was also certified Gold by the RIAA on June 14, 2006. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/Get+Rich+or+Die+Tryin%27"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in 1979 by Casablanca Records, who had had been distributing her work in the U.S. since 1975, and had more or less had full control over distributing her work worldwide since 1977.\n\nBy the time Bad Girls was released, Summer felt that Casablanca were exploiting her. Since the release of her breakthrough, the sexually explicit ""Love to Love You Baby"", Summer had been named ""the first lady of love"" and her record label were keen for her to keep this image up, despite the fact that she was never truly comfortable with it. She was told how to act and dress, and she had generally lost control over her career. Summer became very depressed and suffered with insomnia for a time. She visited healers and began taking tablets to aid her sleep. In early 1979, she collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nUpon Summer\'s recovery, her sister took her to see a priest and she became a born-again Christian. The depression came to an end as a result and Summer set to work on her new album with long-time partners Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, as well as various others she had not worked with before. By this time, although disco music was still popular, other styles such as punk and heavy metal were also achieving well, so the team decided to incorporate a rockier sound into some of the tracks. Other songs had a more soul/R&B feel to them, and in all it was probably Summer\'s most diverse album to date. It became her biggest selling album ever, achieving triple platinum status in the U.S. and shifting about seven million copies worldwide. It also became her second consecutive number-one album in the U.S.\n\nThe fusion of rock and disco was particularly evident also she was using the synthesizer to augment the sound for a more electronic and dance oriented electro music in the first two tracks on the album - ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls"", which also became the first two singles to be released from the album. Both were huge hits and made Number One on the American singles chart. The former also won Summer a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and became popular again in the 1990s when used in the British film The Full Monty. ""Dim All the Lights"" also became a huge hit, peaking at number two in the U.S.\n\n1979 ended with Casablanca releasing a compilation of Summer\'s work plus a couple of newly recorded tracks. At this point, due to the aforementioned feelings that the label was exploiting her, Donna quit the label and signed a new deal with Geffen Records. Her new material with them was more rock/new wave oriented, due to the ""disco backlash"" that had occurred. Due to its popularity, many rock DJs had gone out of business and people begun opposing disco music - around that time many banners were seen with ""disco sucks"" written on them. As a result Summer left the disco tag behind, but in an effort to compete with her new label, Casablanca chose to release more singles from the Bad Girls album - namely ""Sunset People"" and ""Walk Away"". Both were top 20 and 30 hits respectively, while her new rock-oriented dance material climbed the charts. Casablanca/PolyGram also released a special edition compilation entitled Walk Away - Greatest Hits 1977-1980, which featured a selection of her hits from the Bad Girls period and the preceding years.\n\nIn 2003 Universal Music, owners of the Casablanca/PolyGram back catalogue since 1998, re-issued Bad Girls as a digitally remastered and expanded Deluxe Edition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Donna+Summer/Bad+Girls"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother\'s Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band\'s guitarist. Frusciante\'s return was credited with changing the band\'s sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album\'s subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\nCalifornication produced several hits for the band, including ""Otherside"", ""Californication"" and the Grammy Award-winning ""Scar Tissue"". Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the Chili Peppers\' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide; a revitalization in comparison to their previous album, One Hot Minute. The record marked a change in style for the band; Rolling Stone\'s Greg Tate noted that ""while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic.""\n\nAfter their 1995 release One Hot Minute, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released Californication, which saw them reclaiming their extreme notoriety among the alternative rock fraternity. John Frusciante returned to the band in 1998 after leaving in 1992, replacing Dave Navarro as the guitarist. Navarro, of Jane\'s Addiction, gave the band a heavy, psychadelic sound; Frusciante brought back with him the melodic \'punk funk\' that had helped bring the band to stardom. \n\nCalifornication gained positive critical acceptance in contrast to its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, and was a greater success worldwide. Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "" vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility."" Songs such as ""Otherside"" and ""Porcelain"" were called ""Pumpkins-esque"", while the album as a whole was ""epiphanal"" and that the ""RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk\'s real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick."" Other critics credited the album\'s success to the return of Frusciante. Allmusic\'s Greg Prato said that the ""obvious reason for  rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante"", considering him to be the ""quintessential RHCP guitarist"". The album as a whole was ""a bona fide Chili Peppers classic"". Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band\'s sound into a ""more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before"". Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that ""\'This Velvet Glove\' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock,"" Woodlief continued ""the disco intro to \'Parallel Universe\' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante\'s Hendrix-like excursions at the song\'s close.""\n\nWhile many critics found the band\'s new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely utilizing their trademark funk sound, asking: ""Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle."" Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be ""the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now.""\n\nThe album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of The Guardian called ""excessive compression and distortion"" in the process of digital mastering. Stylus Magazine labeled it as one of the victims of the loudness war and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that ""even non-audiophile consumers complained about it"". An unmastered bootleg has been circulated around the internet.\nLoudness War Waveform of bootlegged ""unmastered"" version (top) versus waveform of original CD release (bottom), scaled to show relative volume levels.\n\nOver the years, Californication has maintained its popularity. ""Scar Tissue"" won a Grammy award for best rock song in 2000. The album was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for AOL Sessions that included ""Scar Tissue"" and ""Californication"". The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their Greatest Hits album were taken from Californication.\n\n\nImmediately following the release of Californication, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock \'99, which became infamous for the violence it resulted in. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix\'s song ""Fire"" to finish their set as a favour to Hendrix\'s sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been crowd surfing and moshing were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that ""It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn\'t symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing \'Fire\'.""\n\nTo kick off the band\'s European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow\'s Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis recalled the situation: ""Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage."" Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, and then at the Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Californication"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

So my musical heart was scattered at the time and I wanted the album to show that.""\n\nPost is the second studio album by Icelandic singer-songwriter/musician Björk. It was released in June of 1995. The album was produced in conjunction with Nellee Hooper, Tricky, Graham Massey of 808 State, and electronic music producer Howie B. Building on the success of her previous album Debut, Björk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance and techno. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop-like sounds on tracks like ""Possibly Maybe"". It was these producers\' influence that gave Björk impetus to create material like the storming ""Army of Me"" and ""Enjoy"".However, Björk had not lost her old fascination with Hollywood-style numbers. Her cover of the Betty Hutton track ""Blow a Fuse"", retitled ""It\'s Oh So Quiet"", became one of Björk\'s most well-known moments. After ""Army of Me"" reached the UK top 10, and the subsequent release of ""Isobel"" (which did less well), One Little Indian scheduled ""It\'s Oh So Quiet"" as a novelty Christmas hit. To their surprise, it reached number four in December 1995; it was even later spoofed by The Smurfs. Despite Björk later disowning the song, the commercial attention led to her subsequent single releases ""Hyperballad"" and ""Possibly Maybe"" charting higher than expected.Much material was produced during the album\'s genesis in 1994, including ""I Go Humble"", which would later be released as a B-side. Many of the vocals were recorded in Nassau, Bahamas by Compass Point Studios with Björk standing well out into the ocean at sunset. The vocal for ""Cover Me"" was originally recorded in a nearby bat-infested cave, but was replaced in favour of the studio version. The original version of this song is found on Family Tree, a box set of rare, previously unreleased material.\n\nPost eventually went to number two on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Björk\'s second biggest seller there after Debut. A remix album, Telegram, soon followed and Björk was now officially Iceland\'s biggest musical export.\n\nPost has been certified platinum in the U.S.\n\nThe original cover featured Björk surrounded by silver balls with her tongue extended towards a falling silver ball. It was shot by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who did the sleeve for Debut. The cover was later scrapped, and re-shot by Stéphane Sednaoui. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Post"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman Rivers Cuomo, who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album. However, at the behest of DGC, the band was required to include a producer, and collectively opted for Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. Most of the recording was conducted at Electric Lady Studios in New York City between August and September 1993, a period that coincided with founding guitarist Jason Cropper being fired and replaced by Brian Bell.\n\nUnder Ocasek\'s direction, the band opted for a brighter sound, while bassist Matt Sharp collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments, thus maximizing its potential when united. Lyrically, Weezer focuses on outsiderdom and social awkwardness, while also touching on melancholic themes of love, romance, and familial issues.\n\nWeezer was supported by the singles ""Undone – The Sweater Song"", ""Buddy Holly"", and ""Say It Ain\'t So"", which, alongside their respective music videos, brought Weezer mainstream success. The album itself peaked at number sixteen on the US Billboard 200, and was certified triple platinum by 1995. It is also the band\'s best-selling album, having sold at least 3.3 million copies in the U.S. and over fifteen million copies worldwide by 2009. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Weezer/Weezer+(Blue+Album)"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Shortly after Daft Punk signed with Columbia, a gradual promotional rollout began for the album including billboards, television advertising and a web series.\n\nRandom Access Memories pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has generally been positive.\n\nThis production won Grammy\'s Album of the Year in 2013, Record for the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for ""Get Lucky"", Best Dance/Electro Album & Best Engineered Album (non-classical). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Random+Access+Memories"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Many of its songs reflect a more conventional pop-writing style and became radio hits, others still retain Gabriel\'s dark, brooding sense of experimentalism.\n\nIt is Peter Gabriel\'s second album produced by Canadian artist Daniel Lanois. The previous year, the two of them had worked together on Birdy. Lanois had been previously known for his ambient collaborations with Brian Eno as well as producing U2 since 1984. As he had with the soundtrack to the film Birdy, Lanois brought many of his own ambient sensibilities to this recording.\n\nThe album begins with an emotionally charged piece titled ""Red Rain"". Inspired by a recurring dream which Gabriel had of swimming in a sea of red water, its lyrics vividly depict dream imagery that reflect a sense of vulnerability. The song is one of the works in the story of Mozo, a wandering stranger who appears in several Gabriel songs. Of all the tracks on the album, Gabriel considers ""Red Rain"" one of his favourites. Other Mozo works include ""On the Air"" and ""Exposure"".\n\nThe second track is Peter Gabriel\'s most popular single, ""Sledgehammer"". ""Sledgehammer"" is an upbeat piece with strong Motown influences, and a world music touch from its famous use of the shakuhachi. This song also shows Tony Levin\'s abilities on the bass. The video for ""Sledgehammer"" won MTV\'s 1987 Top Music Video Award. Directed by Steven Johnson, it features stop motion animation by Aardman Animations of Wallace and Gromit fame. The dancing chickens were animated by Nick Park. The video ends with Gabriel dancing in silhouette, covered with lights taped on his suit by a runner who later became a producer for the Wallace and Gromit films. While performing ""Sledgehammer"" on his 2002 tour, Gabriel recreated this image by wearing a jacket covered with LED lights.\n\nTracks 3–6 cover more serious emotional content. These tracks include a duet with Kate Bush titled ""Don\'t Give Up,"" ""That Voice Again,"" and hit single ""In Your Eyes"". ""Mercy Street"" is dedicated to poet Anne Sexton and takes its title from her 1969 play, Mercy Street (Sexton also posthumously released a book of poetry, 45 Mercy Street).\n\nTrack 7 is the album\'s last upbeat pop piece, ""Big Time"". This song is a send-up of the narcissism of the 1980s. It was also accompanied by a video in the vein of ""Sledgehammer"", although to less popularity.\n\nThen comes the album\'s darkest and most experimental track titled ""We Do What We\'re Told (Milgram\'s 37)"". The title refers to the 37 out of 40 compliant subjects of Milgram Experiment 18.\n\nThe album ends with a pictorial and meditative piece titled ""This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)"". This song features vocals with co-writer Laurie Anderson. This track is not included on the original vinyl release of the album, but was added to the audio cassette and CD editions. Anderson had previously recorded a different arrangement of the song entitled ""Excellent Birds"" for her 1984 album, Mister Heartbreak, which also featured vocals by Gabriel. A video rendition of the song featuring Anderson and Gabriel was included in the 1 January 1984 TV satellite broadcast Good Morning, Mr. Orwell. Anderson also performs the song in her concert film Home of the Brave, released around the same time as So.\n\nThis was Gabriel\'s first studio album to bear an official title from its inception. His previous regular albums were simply titled ""Peter Gabriel,"" including 1982\'s Security, which was retitled by Gabriel\'s US label at the time, Geffen Records. It had been speculated that the album was named for the fifth note on the scale(do-re-mi-fa-SO), signifying that it was Gabriel\'s fifth solo album. However, the fifth note of the scale is actually SOL, and according to Peter Gabriel himself, the title did not have any meaning. ""It doesn\'t mean anything"", he said in an interview with Smash Hits in 1986. ""We just liked the form of the word and the two letters. That\'s all.""\n\nWhen the album was remastered in 2002 with most of Gabriel\'s catalogue, the song ""In Your Eyes"" was moved from the fifth song to the ninth song. This was what Peter Gabriel originally intended, but because of the limitations of the vinyl release format it was moved up to be the first track on side two. Oddly, the credits in the booklet were not changed to show the change in order (so, Youssou N\'Dour, instead of being credited with backing vocals to ""In Your Eyes"" is given credit for backing vocals on ""Mercy Street"").\n\nWe Do What We\'re Told (Milgram\'s 37) was featured in an episode of the T.V series Miami Vice.\n\nIn 1998, Q magazine readers voted So the 81st greatest album of all time. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed it at number 91. Rolling Stone magazine places the album at 187 on its list of 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/So"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The title track, performed twice, was a direct narrative about Berry: ""Bruce Berry was a working man/He used to load that Econoline van."" Whitten was heard singing ""Come On Baby Let\'s Go Downtown,"" a live track recorded years earlier. Elsewhere, Young frequently referred to drug use and used phrases that might have described his friends, such as the chorus of ""Tired Eyes,"" ""He tried to do his best, but he could not."" Performing with the remains of Crazy Horse, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina, along with Nils Lofgren (guitar and piano) and Ben Keith (steel guitar), Young performed in the ragged manner familiar from Time Fades Away -- his voice was often hoarse and he strained to reach high notes, while the playing was loose, with mistakes and shifting tempos. But the style worked perfectly for the material, emphasizing the emotional tone of Young\'s mourning and contrasting with the polished sound of CSNY and Harvest that Young also disparaged. He remained unimpressed with his commercial success, noting in ""World on a String,"" ""The world on a string/Doesn\'t mean anything."" In ""Roll Another Number,"" he said he was ""a million miles away/From that helicopter day"" when he and CSN had played Woodstock. And in ""Albuquerque,"" he said he had been ""starvin\' to be alone/Independent from the scene that I\'ve known"" and spoke of his desire to ""find somewhere where they don\'t care who I am."" Songs like ""Speakin\' Out"" and ""New Mama"" seemed to find some hope in family life, but Tonight\'s the Night did not offer solutions to the personal and professional problems it posed. It was the work of a man trying to turn his torment into art and doing so unflinchingly. Depending on which story you believe, Reprise Records rejected it or Young withdrew it from its scheduled release at the start of 1974 after touring with the material in the U.S. and Europe. In 1975, after a massive CSNY tour, Young at the last minute dumped a newly recorded album and finally put Tonight\'s the Night out instead. Though it did not become one of his bigger commercial successes, the album immediately was recognized as a unique masterpiece by critics, and it has continued to be ranked as one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever made. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Tonight%27s+the+Night"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The main exception is the track ""Thank You for the Music"", which, despite being written and recorded in 1977, was in fact released as a single (primarily in the UK) in 1983 after the band had split up. It appears on disc two, along with two bonus tracks, ""Ring Ring"" (1974 UK single remix), and ""Voulez-Vous"" (1979 US promo extended remix). The Australian version of The Definitive Collection adds a further two bonus tracks: ""Rock Me"" and ""Hasta Mañana"". The 1974 remix of ""Ring Ring"" is the first appearance on CD of this version mastered from the original master tape, after the UK single master tapes had been returned to Polar Music by the former UK licensees, Epic Records. The track\'s previous appearance on CD, in a 1999 singles boxed set, was mastered from a vinyl single.\n\nThe Definitive Collection is the only ABBA compilation to include all the UK single releases from 1973 to 1983. The four ""unofficial"" UK ABBA singles are included, these being the 1974 remix of ""Ring Ring"", ""Angeleyes"", ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" and ""Thank You for the Music"". An ""unofficial single"" is one that was not released by ABBA\'s record label, Polar Music, in any Scandinavian country.\n\nA DVD also called The Definitive Collection was released in 2002, and features all of ABBA\'s videos, as well as five bonus videos and a picture gallery. In the US the 2-CD set was bundled with the DVD.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 179 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2012 as The Essential Collection with different artwork. This version removed both bonus tracks but added four tracks for which there were promotional videos: ""Bang-A-Boomerang"", ""That\'s Me"", ""One Man, One Woman"" and ""Happy New Year"". These tracks were included chronologically, and additionally ""Thank You for the Music"" was moved from the end of the album to its chronological place after ""Eagle"". The collection was released as a two-CD set, a DVD, and a three-disc set including the DVD and both CDs. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ABBA/The+Definitive+Collection"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kiss was essentially surviving on then-manager Bill Aucoin\'s American Express card. Complicating matters was the fact that their label, Neil Bogart\'s Casablanca Records, was having financial difficulties of its own stemming from a major misstep: the label had released a double album of Johnny Carson monologues earlier in the year. However, the album was a flop, and Casablanca Records had pressed millions of copies in anticipation. The band and Aucoin were nevertheless able to convince Bogart that a memento of a Kiss show would boost their album sales.\n\nYears later, both guitarist Paul Stanley and bassist Gene Simmons recounted that in the weeks after the release, they saw a significant increase in concert attendance. In the documentary Kiss: X-treme Close Up, Stanley remembers that at one particular show in Dayton, Ohio, ""the place was packed; I mean you couldn\'t have gotten another person in with a shoehorn.""\n\nThere has been considerable debate as to how much use was made of studio overdubs. Gene Simmons states in his autobiography  Kiss and Make-Up that very little corrective work was done in the studio and that most of the studio time was devoted strictly to mixing down the multi-track recordings. He also emphasized that Kiss could not have done extensive overdubbing even if they had wanted to; thanks in no small part to the Johnny Carson album fiasco, the extremely meager budget allotted to the band simply would not allow it.\n\nAccording to Dale Sherman\'s book Black Diamond and Goldmine magazine, in the early 1990s, Eddie Kramer stated there were a few overdubs to correct the most obvious mistakes: strings breaking or off-key notes, for instance. However, in recent years, Kramer has stated that the only original live recording on the album is Ace Frehley\'s guitar. In addition, on the recent VH1 special of the story of Kiss, the band members themselves make it more known that the album was severely doctored in the studio, and various musicians comment on the album in this special, revealing how disappointed they were to find out their heroes doctored the supposed ""live"" album in the studio.\n\nPaul Stanley has noted that there\'s a bass mistake in the choruses of ""C\'mon and Love Me."" He\'s also made comments that even though there have been live albums recorded later that make Alive! sound like it was recorded in a washroom, he has no qualms about it.\n\nAlive! was first issued as a 2CD set in what has now become known as a \'fatboy\' 2CD case. When the Kiss back-catalogue was remastered it was housed in a slimline 2CD case and, in keeping with the rest of the reissue programme, had the artwork restored.\n\nMost recently, Alive! was re-released in 2006 as part of the Kiss Alive! 1975–2000 box set (also featuring Alive II, Alive III and Alive! The Millennium Concert). The short running-time of Alive! allowed for a single, unedited CD edition in this latest release. This remastered CD edition eliminates the breaks between the four sides of the original LP release, resulting in this version of the album playing as one continuous performance. The 72-Page booklet that comes with the CD set erroneously credits songwriting for ""Cold Gin"" to Paul Stanley instead of Ace Frehley.\n\n# It peaked at #9 on the album charts. The album charted for 110 weeks, by far the longest in the band\'s history.\n# In 2003, the album was ranked number 159 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kiss/Alive!"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Notable contributions were also made by guitarist Chris Spedding, bassist Busta Jones, percussionist Marty Simon, and gospel vocal group Sweetfeed. In developing the material with the various musicians, Eno devised unusual methods and instructions to obtain unexpected results\n\nHere Come the Warm Jets peaked at number 26 on the United Kingdom album charts and number 151 on the US Billboard charts, receiving mostly positive reviews. It was re-issued on compact disc in 1990 on Island Records and remastered in 2004 on Virgin Records, and continued to elicit praise.\n\nInitial critical reception for the album was mostly positive, with praise focused on its experimental tendencies. Critic Lester Bangs of Creem declared it ""incredible,"" and noted that ""the predominant feel is a strange mating of edgy dread with wild first-time-out exuberance."" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave it an ""A"" rating, stating that ""The idea of this record—top of the pops from quasi-dadaist British synth wizard—may put you off, but the actuality is quite engaging in a vaguely Velvet Underground kind of way."" Billboard wrote a positive review, stating that ""... while it all may be a bit unpredictable, and may be a longshot to do much in the U.S. market, it is an excellent LP."" The album was also placed in Circus magazine\'s section for ""Picks of the Month"". Cynthia Dagnal of Rolling Stone wrote an article on Eno, calling the album ""a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success."" Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that the album ""still sounds exciting, forward-looking, and densely detailed, revealing more intricacies with every play"". In 1991, Select writer David Cavanagh described it as a ""classic"" album of ""mind-blowing diversity"". In 2003, the album placed at number 436 in Rolling Stone\'s list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", climbing to number 432 in the 2012 update and to number 308 in the 2020 edition. In a retrospective review, Rolling Stone\'s J. D. Considine commented that ""It may be easy to hear both an anticipation of punk and an echo of Roxy Music in the arch clangor of Here Come the Warm Jets, but what shines brightest is the offhand accessibility of the songs"", adding that ""the melodies linger on... the album seems almost a blueprint for the pop experiments Bowie (with Eno collaborating) would conduct with Low"". In 2004, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 24 on its ""Top 100 Albums of the 1970s"" list. In 2003, Blender placed the album on its list ""500 CDs You Must Own: Alternative Rock"", stating that Here Come the Warm Jets ""remains his best pop effort. His experimental touch turns basic glam-rock into something sick and sinister. The free-associating, posh-voiced vocals are an acquired taste, but there\'s method in this madness"". The Canadian music magazine Exclaim! referred to Here Come the Warm Jets as ""Arguably one of the greatest solo debuts of the 1970s... Songs such as ""Baby\'s on Fire"", ""Driving Me Backwards"" and ""Needles in the Camel\'s Eye"" capture the lush and sleazy underpinning narratives of the British Invasion in arrangements that sound quintessentially timeless"".

Recorded during March to April 2000, it contains themes of love that are tied into Harvey\'s affection for New York City.\n\nThe album became the second major commercial success of her recording career, following her successful breakthrough To Bring You My Love (1995). Upon its release, the album received acclaim from most music critics and earned Harvey several accolades, including the 2001 Mercury Prize. It spent 17 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified Platinum in the UK and Australia. It is generally regarded as one of her best works. In the updated version of Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at number 431.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn 1998, while shooting a film as an actress for Hal Hartley in New York, she felt inspired by the city and wrote several songs. Some of them ended on the following album. In 1999, she chose to live there for nine months. However, she insisted in interviews it was not ""my New York album"". Songs were also written while she was in London or at home in Dorset. Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea was then recorded at the Great Linford Manor in Milton Keynes in March–April 2000. The record was co-produced by Mick Harvey, Rob Ellis and Harvey, and mixed by Victor Van Vugt at the Fallout Shelter. The album featured a duet with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on the track ""This Mess We\'re In"", as well as backing vocals and keyboards from Yorke on the songs ""One Line"" and ""Beautiful Feeling"". She had met Yorke in 1992 and they had stayed in contact. She said: ""I\'d long been interested in the idea of somebody else singing a whole song on a record of mine, to have a very different dimension brought in by somebody else\'s voice. It adds so much dynamic within the record to have this other character coming in"".\n\nShe wanted the record to be more direct: ""It\'s very different musically to the first couple of albums. It\'s very melodic, and it\'s much rounder and fuller. The earlier albums were very black and white in some sense, very extreme. Melodically, this is much more sophisticated than those records. It kind of feels like a combination of every album I\'ve made so far rolled into one."" The songs were also a musical departure from her previous dark material. Harvey told Q in 2001, ""I wanted everything to sound as beautiful as possible. Having experimented with some dreadful sounds on Is This Desire? and To Bring You My Love - where I was really looking for dark, unsettling, nauseous-making sounds - Stories From The City... was the reaction. I thought, No, I want absolute beauty. I want this album to sing and fly and be full of reverb and lush layers of melody. I want it to be my beautiful, sumptuous, lovely piece of work."" She did, however, concede jokingly that it was only ""pop according to PJ Harvey, which is probably as un-pop as you can get according to most people\'s standards.""\n\nReception:\n\nStories from the City, Stories from the Sea reached number 23 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was certified Platinum in the UK, with sales over 300,000 copies. The album debuted at number 42 on the US Billboard 200 chart. It has also been certified Gold in France, and has sold 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nStories from the City, Stories from the Sea received critical acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 25 reviews. NME hailed it as ""a magnificent, life-affirming opus"" by Harvey. Robert Christgau called it ""the best album of her career"" in his review for Rolling Stone.\n\nOther critics rated it as only average. Spencer Owen of Pitchfork Media viewed the album as lacking in distinction, saying ""the sheen gets slicker and her music gets duller"". The publication later, however, ranked it at number 124 in their ""The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s"" list in 2009.\n\nAccolades:\n\nThe album earned Harvey BRIT Award nominations as Best British Female Artist for two years running, as well as two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the single ""This Is Love"". For the album, Harvey was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize for the third time (her previous nominations were for Rid of Me and To Bring You My Love). The award ceremony was held on September 11, 2001. Harvey was in Washington, D.C. on that day and witnessed the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon from her hotel room window. She was announced as the winner and accepted her award by phone, saying ""It has been a very surreal day. All I can say is thank you very much, I am absolutely stunned."" The win made Harvey the first female solo artist to receive the Mercury Prize in the award\'s history. The album was ranked number eight on Rolling Stone\'s list of The 50 Essential ""Women In Rock"" Albums. In 2002, Q magazine named ""Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea"" the Greatest Album of All-Time by a Female Artist. In 2006, the album was chosen by Time as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2009, Pitchfork named the album the 124th Top Album of the 2000s. In 2009, NME also placed the album inside their Top 100 Greatest Albums Of The Decade, at number 6. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Rolling Stone named it the thirty-fifth best album of the decade. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey/Stories+From+the+City,+Stories+From+the+Sea"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album has since seen various re-releases, in September 1991, then in 1999 for the 10 year anniversary edition and just recently it was announced their would be a 20th anniversary edition also. It cemented the band\'s reputation among critics, even today, as one of the most important albums ever. In 2006, the writers of NME declared the album the greatest British album of all time.\n\nAs with most Stone Roses releases, the cover displays a work by John Squire. It is a Jackson Pollock-influenced piece titled ""Bye Bye Badman,"" which makes reference to the May 1968 riots in Paris.\n\nThe cover was named by Q magazine as one of ""The 100 Best Covers of All Time."" In the accompanying article, Squire said: ""Ian  had met this French man when he was hitching around Europe, this bloke had been in the riots, and he told Ian how lemons had been used as an antidote to tear gas. Then there was the documentary—-a great shot at the start of a guy throwing stones at the police. I really liked his attitude."" This story was also the inspiration for the lyrics to the song of the same name. The background of the piece is based on the Giant\'s Causeway in Northern Ireland. The band visited the causeway while playing a gig at the University of Ulster in Coleraine.\n\nIn 1989, the critical response was generally positive, and today the album is widely considered to be one of the very best British albums ever released. In 1997, it was named the 2nd greatest album of all time in a ""Music of the Millennium"" poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 4, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 29 in its list of the ""100 Greatest British Albums Ever."" In 2008, it was named the 5th ""greatest British album ever"" by a Q magazine/HMV poll.\n\nThe music weekly NME initially gave the album 7 out of 10, but lavished praise on it in later years. In 2000, it received the ""greatest album ever"" award at the NME Premier Awards show, and in 2006, the album topped the magazine\'s ""100 Greatest British Albums Ever"" list. In summer 2009, NME released a special issue about the album\'s 20th anniversary, labelling it as ""the greatest debut album ever.""\n\nIn 2005, Spin magazine ranked it 78 on its list of the ""100 greatest albums of the past twenty years."" In the same year, when revising the ""500 Greatest Albums"" for book format, Rolling Stone included it as one of the eight new entries placing it at #497. In 2006, Time named it one of ""The All-TIME 100 Albums."" In 2003, Pitchfork Media named it the 39th best album of the 1980s.\n\nLast.fm\'s tracklist is almost entirely wrong. The original UK release of the album is as follows:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 4:52\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:47\n3. Waterfall - 4:41\n4. Don\'t Stop - 5:21\n5. Bye Bye Badman - 4:07\n6. Elizabeth My Dear - 0:56\n7. (Song for My) Sugar Spun Sister - 3:27\n8. Made of Stone - 4:15\n9. Shoot You Down - 4:14\n10. This Is the One - 4:59\n11. I Am the Resurrection - 8:14\n\nThe original US release of the album adds ""Elephant Stone"" (3:04) in between tracks 2 & 3 and ""Fools Gold"" (9:53) at the end of the album. A different 1991 UK release includes the same mix of ""Elephant Stone"" in between tracks 5 and 6, and a shortened single mix of ""Fools Gold"" (4:15) at the end of the album. A 10th anniversary releases uses the original UK track listing and features a bonus disc with the following four songs, plus an enhanced portion with bonus video content, a discography, lyrics, and a photo gallery:\n\n1. Fools Gold - 9:53\n2. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:55\n3. Elephant Stone - 4:48\n4. Where Angels Play - 4:15\n\nA 20th anniversary reissue includes a disc containing early demos for the album, including the following tracks:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 3:45\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:49\n3. Waterfall - 4:47\n4. Bye Bye Badman - 4:08\n5. Sugar Spun Sister - 3:32\n6. Shoot You Down - 4:28\n7. This Is the One - 4:03\n8. I Am the Resurrection - 6:41\n9. Elephant Stone - 3:16\n10. Going Down - 2:42\n11. Mersey Paradise - 2:50\n12. Where Angels Play - 3:19\n13. Something\'s Burning - 3:05\n14. One Love - 6:23\n15. Pearl Bastard - 3:43\n20. Something\'s Burning (hidden track) - 3:39\n\nSeveral editions have an additional bonus disc containing singles, B-sides, and various other outtakes from the era of the album (in particular, including the entirety of the band\'s rarities collection Turns into Stone, though in a different order):\n\n1. Elephant Stone - 4:53\n2. Full Fathom Five - 3:05\n3. The Hardest Thing in the World - 2:44\n4. Going Down - 2:48\n5. Guernica - 4:23\n6. Mersey Paradise - 2:46\n7. Standing Here - 5:09\n8. Simone - 4:25\n9. Fools Gold - 9:55\n10. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:51\n11. One Love - 7:46\n12. Something\'s Burning - 7:45\n13. Where Angels Play - 4:14\n\nAdditional releases contain LPs of the album and bonus material, a USB flash drive, and various other items. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/The+Stone+Roses"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The name of the album is a reference to the painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell.\n\nThe first singles from the album, ""Mariners Apartment Complex"" and ""Venice Bitch"", were released in September 2018, followed by ""Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have – but I Have It"", ""Doin\' Time"", ""The Greatest"", and ""Norman Fucking Rockwell"" in 2019.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year. It was listed by several publications as one of the best albums of the decade, and in the years following its release, of all time. To promote the album, Del Rey embarked on a concert tour, titled The Norman Fucking Rockwell! Tour.\n\nDel Rey announced she had begun working on a follow up material to 2017\'s Lust for Life in January 2018. Del Rey confirmed she had been working on songs including one titled ""Bartender"", but did not know if it would be featured on an album. In September 2018, Del Rey revealed that the album was nearly complete, and that she had recorded eleven tracks for it.  In a September 2019 livestream on Instagram, Del Rey announced that the album was almost named Bird World.\n\nFLOOD Magazine described the album\'s sound as ""a mellow soft rock"" and noted that Del Rey\'s improved lyrics tackle larger themes than her previous work. According to critics, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features ""psych-rock jams"" and piano-based ballads. Consequence of Sound described the record as featuring ""psych-pop lullabies, tales of complicated, consuming romantic love, and overt odes to the tarnished dream of California."" It has been characterised as a ""pop classic"", as well as embodying folk rock, and existing somewhere between the desert rock and ""minimalist"" trip hop of Del Rey\'s previous efforts.\n\nThe album features a strong influence from \'70s classic rock. Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that ""strings and synth washes soundtrack multiple love songs"", and also noted several classic rock references throughout the album, including Neil Young\'s ""Cinnamon Girl"", Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and Led Zeppelin\'s Houses of the Holy. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the album\'s ""Laurel Canyon \'70s soft-rock fantasies"", including references to Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.\n\nNo Ripcord describes Norman Fucking Rockwell! as ""a remarkably sharp pop record that retains her fascination with pop-culture iconography and the rosey simplicity of a post-war America where classic rock and blue jeans ruled and takes them to much deeper places"".\n\nThe album\'s cover art, release date, and track listing were announced by Del Rey on July 31, 2019. The cover art features Del Rey and Duke Nicholson—actor Jack Nicholson\'s grandson—posing on a sailboat, with the album title and Del Rey\'s initials written in a comic-inspired style. The photo was taken by Del Rey\'s sister, photographer Chuck Grant. The following day, Del Rey released an album trailer. On August 2, Urban Outfitters announced an exclusive vinyl of the album featuring an alternative album artwork. The alternative cover was also shot by Chuck Grant.\n\nThroughout 2018, Del Rey shared snippets via social media of several songs intended for the album, including ""Happiness Is a Butterfly"", ""How to Disappear"", and ""Cinnamon Girl"". She performed ""How to Disappear"" on October 29 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, debuting the full song for the first time. A trailer for the album was released on August 1, 2019. It features three of the album\'s singles—""Doin\' Time"", ""Mariners Apartment Complex"", and ""Venice Bitch""—as well as the title track. On August 22, 2019, ""Fuck It, I Love You"" and ""The Greatest"" were released as promotional singles along with a double music video. The music video runs at 9:19 minutes long, with the same shoot as the album trailer.\n\n""Mariners Apartment Complex"" was released as the album\'s first single on September 12, 2018.\n\nThe following week, on September 18, Del Rey released the second single, ""Venice Bitch"" and revealed the album title.\n\n""Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have – but I Have It"" followed as the third single on January 9, 2019.\n\nDel Rey released a cover of Sublime\'s ""Doin\' Time"" on May 17, 2019, for a documentary about the band. It also served as the fourth single from the album. The music video was released on August 29, 2019, one day before the release of her upcoming album; ""Norman Fucking Rockwell!"".\n\nA double music video for ""Fuck It I Love You"" and ""The Greatest"" was released on August 22, 2019. They both served as two promotional singles. ""The Greatest"" was later released as the album\'s fifth single on September 13, 2019, in Italy.\n\n""Norman Fucking Rockwell"", the title track, was released on November 1, 2019 in the UK as the sixth and final single of this era\n\nOn August 1, 2019, Del Rey announced two legs of a tour in promotion of Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The first leg took place in North America in the fall of 2019, and the second in Europe in early 2020. The European leg of the tour was subsequently cancelled due to illness.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, Del Rey released a 14-minute-long short film featuring the songs ""Norman Fucking Rockwell"", ""Bartender"", and ""Happiness is a Butterfly"". The film was directed by Chuck Grant and premiered on YouTube.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread acclaim from music critics and is also the most critically acclaimed studio album of Del Rey\'s career to date. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87 based on 28 reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".\n\nJenn Pelly of Pitchfork wrote that the album ""establishes  as one of America’s greatest living songwriters"". In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that ""the long-awaited Norman Fucking Rockwell is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation\'s most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger."" He concluded that Del Rey ""has finally made her pop classic."" In a five-star review for NME, Rhian Daly called the album ""nothing short of stunning."" Kristel Jax of Now wrote that ""Del Rey has shifted her kitschy patriotic fixation, dropping her flag-draped persona and making peace with a more complex, dystopian reality"", also giving the album five stars. For Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani described the album as being ""a heady collection of psych-rock and piano dirges that pour into each other and rarely shift tempo from track to track"" as well as ""frank assessments of the psychic effects of a world spiraling into chaos."" Also writing positively, Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that ""The album is sultry and soporific, sitting somewhere between the minimalist trip-hop of Del Rey’s early days, and the scuzzy desert rock she has toyed with over the years,"" and concluded that ""This is Del Rey at her most assertive."" In his \'premature evaluation\' for Stereogum, Tom Breihan wrote that the album is ""a beautiful opus for a new dark age — a fond look back at the world we just wrecked"", calling it ""yoga music for the apocalypse.""\n\nIn a more mixed review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the album as ""an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience"", concluding that despite Del Rey\'s evident talent, ""it’s hard not to wish that she would broaden her perspective, adopt a different persona, shake things up a little."" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph similarly wrote that the album ""reveals Del Rey to be something of a one trick pony, but what a beautiful trick it is\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 104,000 album-equivalent units, of which 66,000 were pure album sales, making it Del Rey\'s sixth US top ten album. In its second week, the album dropped to number nine with 35,000 units.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one with 31,539 copies, becoming her best first week sales in the country since Ultraviolence. The album became Lana Del Rey\'s fourth number one album in the UK tying Taylor Swift as the female artist with the most solo number one albums in the UK during the 2010s. In France, the album sold 8,000 copies in its first week, 800 more than Lust for Life\'s first week\n\nLana Del Rey – vocals, horns (9)\nJack Antonoff – keyboards (1–4, 6–8, 11, 13), piano (1–4, 6–8, 11, 13, 14), drums (2–4, 8, 11), programming (2–4, 6–8, 11, 13), acoustic guitar (2–4, 8, 11), electric guitar (2–4, 6–8, 11, 13), synthesizers (3), percussion (8), vibraphone (8)\nEvan Smith – saxophone (1, 11), flute (11)\nPhillip Peterson – baritone (1), cello (1, 6, 11), flugelhorn (1)\nVictoria Parker – violin (1, 6, 11)\nLaura Sisk – additional programming (2)\nChad Smith - drums (4)\nMikey Freedom Hart – keyboards (4), Mellotron (9), piano (9), drums (10), programming (10)\nAndrew Watt – instrumentation (5), programming (5), guitar (5)\nEric Wilson – bass guitar (5)\nJosh Freese – drums (5)\nBud Gaugh – drums (5)\nGale Levant – harp (5)\nWoozy Biff – harp (9)\nZachary Dawes – piano (9)\nLoren Humphrey – drums (9)\nDarren Weiss – drums (9)\nMike Riddleberger – drums (9)\nSean Hutchinson – drums (9)\nEvan Weiss – guitar (9)\nBenji Lysaght – guitar (9)\nTyler Parkford – Hammond B3 (9)\nDean Reid – bass guitar (9), keyboards (10), guitar (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nKieron Menzies – Mellotron (9), drums (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nRick Nowels – keyboards (10), acoustic guitar (10), piano (12)\nGrace Wang – keyboards (1)\nZac Rae – keyboards (10)\nDavid Levita – guitar (10) <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Norman+Fucking+Rockwell!"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in 1980 as a triple album containing 36 tracks, with 6 songs on each side. Anticipating the ""world music"" trend of the 1980s, it features reggae, jazz, mock gospel, rockabilly, folk, dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, and rap.\n\nFor the first time, the band\'s traditional songwriting credits of Strummer/Jones were replaced by a generic credit to ""The Clash"",and the band cut the album royalties, in order to release the 3-LP at a low price. The title comes from the Nicaraguan left-wing guerrilla organization, the Sandinistas, and its catalogue number, \'FSLN1\', refers to the acronym for Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional.\n\nSandinista! was voted the best album of the year in The Village Voice\'s Pazz & Jop critics poll, and it was ranked number 404 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all timeThe album was recorded over most of 1980, in London, Manchester, Jamaica and New York. It was produced by the band (which essentially meant Mick Jones and Joe Strummer), recorded and mixed by Bill Price, and engineered by Jeremy ""Jerry"" Green (Wessex Sound Studios), J. P. Nicholson (Electric Lady Studios), Lancelot ""Maxie"" McKenzie (Channel One Studios), and Bill Price (Pluto + Power Station Studios). Dub versions for some of the songs and toasting was done by Mikey Dread, who had first hooked up with the band for their 1980 single ""Bankrobber"". With Sandinista! the band reached beyond punk and reggae into dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, gospel and other genres. The album clearly displays the influence of reggae and in particular producer Lee ""Scratch"" Perry (who had worked with the band on their 1977 single ""Complete Control"" and who had opened some of the band\'s shows during its stand at Bond\'s in New York in 1980), with a dense, echo-filled sound on even the straight rock songs.\n\nWhen recording began in New York bass guitarist Paul Simonon was busy making a film, and he was replaced briefly by Ian Dury and the Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy; this later caused some bad feeling when Watt-Roy and keyboard player Mickey Gallagher, a fellow Blockhead, claimed they were responsible for co-composing the song ""The Magnificent Seven"", as the song was based on a tune of theirs. Dread, too, was upset that he was not credited as the album\'s producer, although he was credited with ""Version Mix."" Other guests on the album include actor Tim Curry (providing the voice of a priest on ""The Sound of Sinners""), singer Ellen Foley (Jones\' partner at the time), former Voidoids guitarist Ivan Julian, former Eddie and the Hot Rods member Lew Lewis, and Strummer\'s old friend and musical collaborator Tymon Dogg, who plays violin, sings on and wrote the track ""Lose This Skin""; he later joined Strummer\'s band The Mescaleros. Mickey Gallagher\'s children also made appearances: his two sons, Luke and Ben, singing a version of ""Career Opportunities"" from the band\'s first album, and his daughter Maria singing a snippet of ""The Guns of Brixton"", from London Calling, at the end of the track ""Broadway"".\n\nThis is also the only Clash album on which all four members have a lead vocal. Drummer Topper Headon made a unique lead vocal contribution on the disco song ""Ivan Meets G.I. Joe"", and bassist Paul Simonon sings lead on ""The Crooked Beat""..\n\nFour singles were released from the Sandinista! sessions in the UK: ""Bankrobber"" (which did not appear on the album), ""The Call Up"", ""Hitsville UK"", and ""The Magnificent Seven"". The last deserves mention as possibly the first-ever British rap single and as one of the first rap singles by a white band.\n\nThe triple-LP set was, like London Calling, a subject of trickery towards the record company from the band. Two contradictory accounts of the release of the album exist. Some say that the Clash pulled the same trick a second time by saying they wanted to include a 12"" single with their double album, and then getting 3 full-length discs pressed before executives became wise. Another belief is that The Clash surrendered all of their album royalties for the first 200,000 copies sold in order to make the 3-LP set a reality. Joe Strummer said in an interview by Judy McGuire for Punk Magazine: ""Well, now you\'re talking to a man who forewent the royalties on Sandinista!"" Regardless of which of these is true, either situation paints the band in a good light, putting their fans before and above any other involved entity.\n\nA one-LP distillation of the album, called Sandinista Now!, was sent to press and radio. The side one track listing was ""Police on My Back"", ""Somebody Got Murdered"", ""The Call Up"", ""Washington Bullets"", ""Ivan Meets G.I. Joe"" and ""Hitsville U.K."". The side two track listing was ""Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""The Leader"", ""Junco Partner"", ""One More Time"" and ""The Sound of Sinners"".\n\nThe song ""Washington Bullets"" was Clash lyric-writer Joe Strummer\'s most extensive—and most specific—political statement to date. In it, Strummer name checks conflicts or controversies from around the world; namely in Chile, Nicaragua, Cuba, Afghanistan and Tibet. (In reference to the first three, Strummer seems to side with what he sees as popular leftist movements or governments, while in the latter two, he sharply criticizes the policy of Moscow\'s and Beijing\'s communist governments for what he sees as their imperialist actions). The original Rolling Stone review of Sandinista! calls ""Washington Bullets"", along with ""The Equaliser"" and ""The Call Up"", ""the heart of the album"".\n\nThe original, 3-disc vinyl release of ""Sandinista"" included a tri-fold lyric sheet cleverly titled The Armagideon Times, no. 3 (a play on ""Armagideon Time"", the b-side from the single London Calling.) Armagideon Times, nos. 1 and 2 were Clash fanzines. The lyric sheet featured cartoons credited to Steve Bell, as well as hand-written (but still legible) lyrics of all songs. The 2-CD release contains a facsimile of the lyric sheet considerably reduced in size.\n\nJoe Strummer once told Rolling Stone magazine that the concept for a triple-LP (a rarity in the rock music world) came from friendly competition with American artist Bruce Springsteen. When their earlier LP London Calling was released in 1980, critics said that Springsteen\'s upcoming double-disc album The River would outsell the Clash effort and wipe away any impact. Strummer\'s response was: ""Right Bruce. Suck on this"". The band then expanded Sandinista into a triple album <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/Sandinista!"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Clocks, a song centered around a cyclic piano riff and included on the album only at the last minute, ultimately became the band\'s largest hit to date, earning the band a Grammy for Record of the Year.\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head also won the 2002 Grammy for Best Alternative Album.

But those shows weren\'t easily available whereas Live at Leeds was, and even if this show may not have been the absolute best, it\'s so damn close to it that it would be impossible for anybody but aficionados to argue. Here, the Who sound vicious -- as heavy as Led Zeppelin but twice as volatile -- as they careen through early classics with the confidence of a band that finally achieved acclaim but had yet to become preoccupied with making art. In that regard, this recording -- in its many different forms -- may have been perfectly timed in terms of capturing the band at a pivotal moment in its history. \n\nThere is certainly no better record of how this band was a volcano of violence on-stage, teetering on the edge of chaos but never blowing apart. This was most true on the original LP, which was a trim six tracks, three of them covers (""Young Man Blues,"" ""Summertime Blues,"" ""Shakin\' All Over"") and three originals from the mid-\'60s, two of those (""Substitute,"" ""My Generation"") vintage parts of their repertory and only ""Magic Bus"" representing anything resembling a recent original, with none bearing a trace of its mod roots. This was pure, distilled power, all the better for its brevity; throughout the \'70s the album was seen as one of the gold standards in live rock & roll, and certainly it had a fury that no proper Who studio album achieved. It was also notable as one of the earliest legitimate albums to implicitly acknowledge -- and go head to head with -- the existence of bootleg LPs. Indeed, its very existence owed something to the efforts of Pete Townshend and company to stymie the bootleggers. \n\nThe Who had made extensive recordings of performances along their 1969 tour, with the intention of preparing a live album from that material, but they recognized when it was over that none of them had the time or patience to go through the many dozens of hours of live performances in order to sort out what to use for the proposed album. According to one account, the band destroyed those tapes in a massive bonfire, so that none of the material would ever surface without permission. They then decided to go to the other extreme in preparing a live album, scheduling this concert at Leeds University and arranging the taping, determined to do enough that was worthwhile at the one show. As it turned out, even here they generated an embarrassment of riches -- the band did all of Tommy, as audiences of the time would have expected (and, indeed, demanded), but as the opera was already starting to feel like an albatross hanging around the collective neck of the band (and especially Townshend), they opted to leave out any part of their most famous work apart from a few instrumental strains in one of the jams. Instead, the original LP was limited to the six tracks named, and that was more than fine as far as anyone cared. \n\nAnd fans who bought the original LP got a package of extra treats for their money. The original album\'s plain brown sleeve was, itself, a nod and nudge to the bootleggers, resembling the packaging of such early underground LP classics as the Bob Dylan Great White Wonder set and the Rolling Stones concert bootleg Liver Than You\'ll Ever Be, from the latter group\'s 1969 tour -- and it was a sign of just how far the Who had come in just two years that they could possibly (and correctly) equate interest in their work as being on a par with Dylan and the Stones. But Live at Leeds\' jacket was a foldout sleeve with a pocket that contained a package of memorabilia associated with the band, including a really cool poster, copies of early contracts, etc. It was, along with Tommy, the first truly good job of packaging for this band ever to come from Decca Records; the label even chose to forgo the presence of its rainbow logo, carrying the bootleg pose to the plain label and handwritten song titles, and the note about not correcting the clicks and pops. At the time, you just bought this as a fan, but looking back 30 or 40 years on, those now seem to be quietly heady days for the band (and for fans who had supported them for years), finally seeing the music world and millions of listeners catch up. \n\nThe album was duly re-released on compact disc in its original six-track version early in the CD era. But the increasingly common practice of adding bonus tracks and going back to original source tapes eventually caught up with the Who. In the \'90s, Live at Leeds was expanded twice, first as a superb 14-track single disc containing excerpts of their Tommy performance from that February 14, 1970, gig, along with all the non-Tommy music, and then in 2001 as a double-disc deluxe edition containing the entirety of the show. It\'s a treat to hear more (or all, depending on the edition) of this great performance, all in remastered sound, but there\'s something to be said for the original LP, which packed a lethal, lean punch quite unlike any other Who album. And what is equally amazing, hearing whatever form of the album one happens to have, is the nature of the performances -- one realizes, hearing them do ""Substitute,"" not how much it sounds like the record (though it does), but rather how amazingly fully the Who of 1965-1966 captured their live sound in that record; neither the Beatles, for certain, nor even the Rolling Stones ever nailed their live sound quite so well on their studio sides. \n\nThe same is true, in the expanded version, of ""Tattoo,"" ""I Can\'t Explain,"" ""Happy Jack,"" etc., so that hearing this album -- superb as it is in its own right as a self-contained musical entity -- only elevated the level of respect one felt for the band across its entire recorded history. And then there were those extended jams, moving from ""My Generation"" and ""Magic Bus"" into new and expansive territory, and showing that numbers like ""Sparks"" and ""Amazing Journey"" on Tommy had not been side-filling studio indulgences, but honest studio captures of the kind of playing that Townshend, Keith Moon, and John Entwistle had been doing for years. And this album, especially in its original LP form and in the single-CD expanded version, also showcased exactly how much Tommy, and a year of performing it on-stage, had improved Roger Daltrey\'s singing in intonation, control, and sheer power. It was the greatest Who album heard up to that time, and one of the best live albums ever done by anyone -- and ironically enough, was a stopgap release, to give the band time to finish its next project, the film Lifehouse. Even more ironically, the latter would never get completed, but in salvaging it the Who would create Who\'s Next, an album that came as close to matching Live at Leeds\n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/Live+at+Leeds"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rolling Stone magazine hailed it ""as close to art as pop music gets"". It was recorded in 1988 with collaborators Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, and also includes a duet with R&B pop singer Prince. It featured the first of several songs throughout her career in which she talked openly about her mother\'s death, Promise to Try; Madonna even dedicated the album to ""my mother who taught me to pray"". She also addresses the end of her marriage to actor Sean Penn in the song Till Death Do Us Part.\n\nBefore the commercial release of the first single and title track, Pepsi decided to use the song as part of their soft drink commercial featuring Madonna. In addition to this, the company had also struck a deal to sponsor her 1990 Blond Ambition Tour. The commercial was aired twice before the release of the music video on MTV. Pepsi had no idea about the controversial content depicted in the video; Madonna witnesses a murder, kisses a black saint, displays stigmata after cutting her palms on a knife, and dances in a field of burning crosses. Religious groups were furious and threatened to boycott Pepsi. They decided the risk was too great, and they cancelled their ad campaign and sponsorship deal, although Madonna got to keep the $5 million in her contract. \n\nDue to the high publicity surrounding the controversy, the single soared to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The album debuted at number eleven, and within three weeks, shot to number one, where it would stay for over a month. Singles Express Yourself and Cherish both made it to number two. Oh Father was her least successful single since 1984, but still became a top twenty hit, peaking at number twenty. Keep It Together reached number eight on the charts, and Dear Jessie was also a hit single in Europe, and had an animated video.\n\nAccording to a list released by Time magazine on November 13, 2006, Like a Prayer is one of the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n\nProfessional Reviews\nAllMusic - ★★★★★\nRolling Stone - ★★★★★\nSlant - ★★★★★\nRobert Christgau - B+ <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/Like+a+Prayer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The recording sessions took place on January 10 and January 11 at the RCA Victor recording studios in Nashville, Tennessee, and on January 30 and January 31 at the RCA Victor studios in New York. Additional material originated from sessions at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 5, August 19 and September 10 of 1954, and on July 11, 1955.\n\nThe album spent ten weeks at number one on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart in 1956, the first rock and roll album ever to make it to the top of the charts, and the first million-selling album of that genre. In 2003, it was ranked number 56 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. Elvis Presley was also one of three Presley albums to receive accolades in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, the others being Elvis Is Back! and From Elvis in Memphis. It was certified Gold on November 1, 1966 and Platinum on August 8, 2011 by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe original 1956 UK release called Rock n\' Roll on HMV Catalog Number: CLP 1093 has six different tracks.\n\nBy the second half of 1955, singles on Sun Records by Presley began making the national country and western singles chart, ""Baby Let\'s Play House"" and ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget"" going to number 5 and number 1 respectively. Colonel Tom Parker, the new manager of Presley, had extensive dealings with RCA through his previous client, singer Eddy Arnold, especially with the head of the Country and Western and Rhythm and blues division, Steve Sholes. At the urging of Parker, on November 21, 1955, Sholes bought Presley\'s contract from Sam Phillips, the head of Sun Records and Studio, for the unprecedented sum of $35,000 (approximately $318,500 in 2017 dollars). Presley and rock and roll were still untested properties for the major labels in the music business, but this album, along with the number one single ""Heartbreak Hotel"", proved the selling power of both: it was the first RCA Victor pop album to earn more than $1,000,000, and in 1956 it had sold over one million units.\n\nPresley made appearances in four consecutive weeks on the Dorsey Brothers television program Stage Show in early 1956, on January 28, February 4, February 11, and February 18. RCA wanted an album in the stores fast to capitalize both on the nationwide TV exposure and the success of his first hit single on the pop charts with ""Heartbreak Hotel"", swiftly climbing to the top after its release on January 27. At the same time, there had only been two series of Presley recording sessions for RCA Victor by the end of the Dorsey stint, after which Presley and his band were back on the road. Those two sessions yielded an additional eleven tracks, almost enough to fill an entire LP, although some tracks had singles potential. In the 1950s, general practice dictated tracks having greater commercial potential to be released as singles, with tracks of lesser appeal placed on albums; as such, RCA Victor neither took all eleven tracks and simply made an album, nor placed the already released and briskly-selling ""Heartbreak Hotel"" on it. The rights to the Sun Studio tapes had transferred to RCA Victor with the sale of his contract, so five previously unreleased Sun songs, ""I Love You Because"", ""Just Because"", ""Tryin\' to Get to You"", ""I\'ll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin\')"", and ""Blue Moon"" were added to seven of the RCA Victor sessions tracks to bring the running time of the album up to an acceptable length. Phillips produced the sessions at Sun, and no producer was officially listed for the RCA Victor sessions, leading to the belief that Presley himself produced them.\n\nAs the Sun tracks were mostly country-styled, Elvis and RCA Victor leavened the selections with covers of recent rhythm and blues songs. Two of these, ""Money Honey"" by Jesse Stone, known to Elvis from a version by Clyde McPhatter, and Ray Charles\' 1955 hit ""I Got a Woman"", had been in Presley\'s live act for a year. A third was the frenetic announcement to the world of the existence of Little Richard in 1955, ""Tutti Frutti"". A rockabilly number that was believed to be a potential hit and could hold its own with the R&B material, ""Blue Suede Shoes"", was not initially released as a single from a promise by Sholes to Sam Phillips to protect the career of another Sun artist, Carl Perkins, the author of the song. Instead, it was diverted into being the opening track on the album.\n\nOn August 31, 1956, RCA Victor took the unusual step of releasing the entire album as singles, which undoubtedly kept the new single released simultaneously, ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" backed with ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy,"" from reaching the charts. However, ""Blue Suede Shoes"", released in single form as a part of this experiment by RCA Victor, kept the promise to Phillips and Perkins by waiting over eight months since the song\'s release on Sun and made it to number 20 on the singles chart.\n\nThe cover is ranked number 40 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 100 greatest album covers, published in 1991. The iconic photograph of Elvis was taken at the Fort Homer Hesterly Armory in Tampa, Florida, on July 31, 1955. Initially, it was thought that Popsie Randolph took the image featured on the front cover, since the album only credited one photographer. However, in August 2002, Joseph A. Tunzi documented that the actual photographer was William V. ""Red"" Robertson of Robertson & Fresch. The Popsie credit attributed to the album only applied to a series of photos featured on the back cover, taken in New York City in early December 1955, shortly after Presley had signed with RCA Victor. Tunzi was quoted in the Tampa Tribune as saying, ""Forget about Popsie. Popsie did not take that photo."" \n\nThe graphic and photo were also used on an EP and a double-EP comprising songs from this album, also released in March 1956.\n\nThe design was echoed by The Clash for the front of their 1979 album London Calling; that cover is number 39 on the Rolling Stone list of 100 greatest album covers noted previously. Other acts of cover homage include F-Punk by Big Audio Dynamite in 1995 and Reintarnation in 2006 by k.d. lang, Rise Up by Sir Cliff Richard in 2018 and Chumbawamba\'s controversial single ""Tony Blair"".\n\nRCA first reissued the original 12 track album on compact disc in 1984. This issue, in reprocessed (fake) stereo sound, was quickly withdrawn and the disc was reissued in original monophonic. In 1999, RCA reissued the album with an altered running order, adding on six bonus tracks from three non-album singles, including the chart-toppers ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You."" In 2005, the album was reissued again, remastered using DSD technology with the six bonus tracks appended in standard fashion.

It\'s rich, subtly layered music, but its best attribute is that it comes on easy, never sounding labored or overworked. In fact, it takes several spins of the album to realize just how versatile Withers is on Still Bill, to hear how he makes intricate, funky rhythms sound as effortless and simple as the album\'s best-known song, the gospel-tinged inspirational anthem ""Lean on Me."" That\'s the genius behind Withers\' music: it\'s warm and easily accessible, but it has a depth and complexity that reveals itself over numerous plays -- and, given the sound and feel of the music, from the lush arrangements to his comforting voice, it\'s easy to want to play this again and again. Then there\'s the quality of the songwriting, which is as assured on the grooving ""Lonely Town, Lonely Street"" as it is on the suspicious, paranoid ""Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?"" or ""Use Me,"" where he happily submits to being used by his object of affection. This high level of songwriting is sustained throughout the record, making this the greatest testament to his considerable gifts.  ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/Still+Bill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album also demonstrates Santana\'s stylistic versatility, including tracks such as ""Samba pa Ti"" (a classic slow-burning, seductive piece) and ""Incident at Neshabur"", both being instrumentals. The latter has several rhythm and time signature changes consistent with its jazz feel. Latin percussion — congas, bongos and timbales, as well as a conventional rock drum setup, make this Santana\'s first foray into true Latin rhythm. In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album achieved number 7 in the UK album charts\nThe title of the album comes from a line from Herman Hesse\'s book Demian:We stood before it and began to freeze inside from the exertion. We questioned the painting, berated it, made love to it, prayed to it: We called it mother, called it whore and slut, called it our beloved, called it Abraxas...\nThe album\'s cover features the 1961 painting Annunciation, by Mati Klarwein. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Santana/Abraxas"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As many bootlegs (most notably the complete five-disc series) reveal, this isn\'t entirely true and the Band were nowhere near as active as Dylan, but that ultimately is a bit like nitpicking, since the music here (including the Band\'s) is astonishingly good. The party line on The Basement Tapes is that it is Americana, as Dylan and the Band pick up the weirdness inherent in old folk, country, and blues tunes, but it transcends mere historical arcana through its lively, humorous, full-bodied performances. Dylan never sounded as loose, nor was he ever as funny as he is here, and this positively revels in its weird, wild character. For all the apparent antecedents -- and the allusions are sly and obvious in equal measure -- this is truly Dylan\'s show, as he majestically evokes old myths and creates new ones, resulting in a crazy quilt of blues, humor, folk, tall tales, inside jokes, and rock. The Band pretty much pick up where Dylan left off, even singing a couple of his tunes, but they play it a little straight, on both their rockers and ballads. Not a bad thing at all, since this actually winds up providing context for the wild, mercurial brilliance of Dylan\'s work -- and, taken together, the results (especially in this judiciously compiled form with its expert song selection, even if there\'s a bit too much Band) rank among the greatest American music ever made. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan+and+The+Band/The+Basement+Tapes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.\n\nNoted for its use of sample loop and utilizing swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, the album encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It became the singer\'s second consecutive album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. Certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it became the country\'s best-selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson\'s artistic achievement. It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends, inspiring numerous artists.\n\nIt is the only album in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart to have seven commercial singles peak within the top five positions. It is also the only album to produce number one hits on the chart in three separate calendar years (1989–1991). The 30-minute Rhythm Nation 1814 film, a screenplay depicting two aspiring musicians whose lives are disrupted by substance abuse, aired on MTV to promote the album. Jackson received nine Grammy Award nominations, becoming the first woman to be nominated for Producer of the Year and winning Best Long Form Music Video for Rhythm Nation 1814. Her Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut concert tour by a recording artist, in addition to setting venue records in Japan. She was regarded as a fashion icon, with her ""Rhythm Nation"" attire being emulated by youth. Proceeds from the tour were used to establish the Rhythm Nation Scholarship and fund other educational programs. Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award and the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her significant contributions to popular culture. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Janet+Jackson/Rhythm+Nation+1814"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

From Brother J.C. Crawford\'s rabble-rousing introduction to the final wash on feedback on ""Starship,"" Kick Out the Jams is one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made; Wayne Kramer and Fred ""Sonic"" Smith were a lethal combination on tightly interlocked guitars, bassist Michael Davis and drummer Dennis Thompson were as strong a rhythm section as Detroit ever produced, and Rob Tyner\'s vocals could actually match the soulful firepower of the musicians, no small accomplishment. Even on the relatively subdued numbers (such as the blues workout ""Motor City Is Burning""), the band sound like they\'re locked in tight and cooking with gas, while the full-blown rockers (pretty much all of side one) are as gloriously thunderous as anything ever committed to tape; this is an album that refuses to be played quietly. For many years, Detroit was considered the High Energy Rock & Roll Capital of the World, and Kick Out the Jams provided all the evidence anyone might need for the city to hold onto the title. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/MC5/Kick+Out+the+Jams"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As usual with Stevie Wonder albums though, we get a healthy mix of both optimistic upbeat songs (such as ""I Love Every Little Thing About You"") and heartbreaking love stories (""Girl Blue"" and ""Superwoman"" which are both about females who can\'t seem to put their rather indepedent mindsets behind themselves to have successful relationships). We hear the additional electric guitar backing from Buzz Feiten on the second half of ""Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)"" which acts as a sequel to ""I Never Dreamed You\'d Leave in Summer"" that was on Where I\'m Coming From and it\'s likely to be the album\'s highest point in eyes and ears of it\'s listeners. Almost remarkably, Wonder manages to put this album together with little additional input outside of co-writing credits to Syreeta and Yvonne Wright, Art Baron\'s tamborine playing on funk driven ""Love Having You Around"", and of course Feiten\'s guitar as mentioned earlier. Throughout the album we hear Stevie expound upon the highs and lows of romantic relationships which is much like a emotional rollercoaster, one minute he\'s ""Happier than the Morning Sun"" and the next minute he\'s ""left alone to suffer"" on ""Seems So Long"" and is searching for a new love chronicled clearly on church choir infused ""Keep On Running"". The finale testament of the album is not about love at all though, rather it\'s a question of ""Evil""\'s placement in the world.

It was released on February 23, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem\'s recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.\n\nFeaturing West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP\'s lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem\'s alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as ""made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,"" describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC\'s FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, ""My Name Is"", became Eminem\'s first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while ""My Name Is"" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nWhile The Slim Shady LP\'s success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album\'s success was vital in breaking the stereotype that ""white people cannot rap"", and has since been included in several publications\' lists of the greatest albums of all time. Spin later included it in their list of ""The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014"".\n\nBackground\n\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: ""After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, \'You\'re a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don\'t you go into rock & roll?\' All that type of shit started pissing me off."" After the release of Infinite, Eminem\'s personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: ""Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it."" Slim Shady served as Eminem\'s vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, ""In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, \'Find him. Now.\'"" Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, ""I don\'t give a fuck if you\'re purple. If you can kick it, I\'m working with you."" Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem\'s major-label debut album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Slim Shady LP was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: ""I didn\'t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I\'m just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre."" However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; ""Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for"", Eminem recalled. He later said: ""Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them."" On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished ""My Name Is"" in an hour. Three other songs, including ""Role Model"", were also recorded that day.\n\n""\'97 Bonnie & Clyde"", which was formerly featured on the Slim Shady EP as ""Just the Two of Us"", was re-recorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie\'s vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend\'s corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese\'s. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, ""When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out."" Eminem also said, ""When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I\'m going to explain it to her. I\'ll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren\'t getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it."" The song ""Guilty Conscience"" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre ""fell out of his chair laughing"" upon hearing the lyric.\n\n""Ken Kaniff"", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem\'s breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in The Marshall Mathers LP 2. Another skit, ""Bitch"", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem\'s music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album. During the mixing process of The Slim Shady LP, at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, Devil Without a Cause; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem\'s song ""My Fault"", which appears on The Slim Shady LP; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock\'s song ""Fuck Off"" for Devil Without a Cause.\n\nProduction\nThe album\'s production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that ""The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play."" According to the staff at IGN, ""\'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" is backed by the ""lulling serenity of a super silky groove"". ""Cum on Everybody""; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while ""My Name Is"", which is built around a sample from British musician Labi Siffre\'s ""I Got The"", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. ""I\'m Shady"" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield\'s ""Pusherman"" in Ice-T\'s song ""I\'m Your Pusher"", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use ""Pusherman"".\n\nEminem\'s vocal inflection on the album has been described as a ""nasal whine""; Jon Pareles of The New York Times likened his ""calmly sarcastic delivery"" to ""the early Beastie Boys turned cynical"". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper\'s vocals to ""Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent"". A skit entitled ""Lounge"" appears before ""My Fault"" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line ""I never meant to give you mushrooms"" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write ""My Fault"".\n\nLyrical themes\n\nMany of the songs from The Slim Shady LP are written from the perspective of Eminem\'s alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as ""made-up tales of trailer-park stuff"". The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: ""Why can\'t people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren\'t on a screen."" Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, ""I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I\'m saying shit about women, when I\'m saying \'bitches\' and \'hoes\', it\'s so ridiculous that I\'m taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don\'t hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.\'"" Despite the album\'s explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word ""nigga"" on the album, noting, ""It\'s not in my vocabulary."" The Slim Shady LP begins with a ""Public Service Announcement"" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album\'s explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled ""Paul"" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to ""tone down"" his lyrics.\n\n""Guilty Conscience"" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the ""angel"" and ""devil"" sides of the characters\' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon\'s Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in ""Guilty Conscience"", the outcome is unclear. On ""My Fault"", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. ""\'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife\'s corpse. It is an epilogue to the song ""Kim"", although ""\'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that ""There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it\'s not because of what it describes, it\'s how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words."" On the song ""Brain Damage"", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school, particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully.\n\nAlthough many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem\'s frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as ""probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks."" Eminem was inspired to write ""Rock Bottom"" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter\'s birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as ""discouraged, hungry, and malnourished."" ""If I Had"" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is ""tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour"". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the ""white trash"" stereotype.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album was met with critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper\'s ""expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination"", adding that ""Years later, as the shock has faded, it\'s those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they\'re what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music."" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album\'s ""unapologetic outrageousness"" as a reaction to the ""soul positivity"" of conscious hip hop, noting that ""The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch."" Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that ""He isn\'t afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it\'s a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time"" but lamented the ""sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem\'s verbal mayhem.""\n\nMany reviewers commented on the album\'s lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, ""Eminem\'s music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn\'t help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away."" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record\'s comedic nature, writing ""Simply put: Eminem will crack you up"", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that ""the wife-killing jokes of ""97 Bonnie and Clyde\' aren\'t any funnier than Garth Brooks\', and \'My Fault\' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record."" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is ""sophomoric and uninspired"" at times, Eminem\'s ""surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that\'s despairingly low on new ideas."" Mike Rubin of Spin noted that ""his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are."" Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that ""Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre\'s lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together."" Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1999, Robert Christgau called the record a ""platinum-bound cause celebre"" and, despite succumbing to ""dull sensationalism"" toward the end, Eminem shows ""more comic genius than any pop musician since"", possibly, Loudon Wainwright III.""\n\nAccolades\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Eminem\nAt the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while ""My Name Is"" won Best Rap Solo Performance. Rolling Stone ranked The Slim Shady LP number 275 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and 33 on its list of the ""100 Best Albums of the \'90s"". Blender ranked it number 49 in its list of The 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. ""Ken Kaniff"" was listed as number 15 on Complex\'s ""50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits"" list, while the ""Public Service Announcement"" introduction to the album, along with the ""Public Service Announcement 2000"" introduction from The Marshall Mathers LP, was listed as number 50 on the list. It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards. In 2015, it was ranked at number 76 by About.com in their list of ""100 best hip-hop albums of all time"". Christgau later named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nIn the album\'s first week of release, The Slim Shady LP sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart behind TLC\'s FanMail. The record remained on the Billboard 200 for 100 weeks. It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks. On April 5, 1999, The Slim Shady LP was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. On November 15, 2000, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. ""My Name Is"", the album\'s lead single, peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the chart for ten weeks. The single additionally peaked at number 18 on the magazine\'s R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 29 on the Pop Songs chart, and 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. ""Guilty Conscience"" reached number 56 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while ""Just Don\'t Give a Fuck"" peaked at number 62 on the chart.\n\nBy November 2013, the album sold 5,437,000 copies in the United States. on the weekly Canadian Albums Chart and remained on the chart for twelve weeks. Additionally, the album was certified triple platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 units. The album was also certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Albums chart and remained on the chart for a total of 114 weeks. In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album had also peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions in the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively. It was certified gold in the Netherlands and platinum in New Zealand.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the success of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: ""This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn\'t born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she\'s got one now. I can\'t stop myself from spoiling her. To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs.] He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, ""I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder."" However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as ""misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence"", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of ""making money by exploiting the world\'s misery."" During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about ""slapping a pregnant bitch"" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP. The rapper defended himself by saying, ""My album isn\'t for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn\'t mean younger kids won\'t get it, but I\'m not responsible for every kid out there. I\'m not a role model, and I don\'t claim to be.\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem\'s mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line ""I just found out my mom does more dope than I do"" from ""My Name Is"". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a ""lawsuit queen"", and alleging that ""That\'s how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don\'t remember her working a day in her life."" She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song ""Brain Damage"" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey\'s attorney stated ""Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a \'pretender\' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism."" In 1982, Eminem\'s mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem\'s entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey\'s lawyer ruled out any further appeals.\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that ""Guilty Conscience"" contains an unauthorized sample of ""Go Home Pigs"" composed for the film Getting Straight by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album\'s liner notes state that the song contains an ""interpolation"" of ""Go Home Pigs"", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Slim+Shady+LP"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was re-issued on compact disc decades later and received much greater praise from modern critics, including being listed highly in Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nProduction\n\nBefore recording the album, Mac Rebennack was an experienced New Orleans R&B and rock musician playing as a session musician, songwriter, and producer in New Orleans. Due to drug problems and the law, Dr.John moved to Los Angeles in 1965, joining an a group of New Orleans session musicians. Rebennack survived by playing with various pop and rock recording sessions, receiving much of this work with the help of New Orleanian arranger Harold Battiste.\n\nRebennack desired to make an album that combined the various strains of New Orleans music behind a front man named Dr. John. Dr. John was to be named after a black man named Dr. John Montaine who claimed to be an African potentate. Rebennack chose this name because his sister knew information about Montaine and that Rebennack felt a ""spiritual kinship"" with him. Rebennack originally wanted New Orleans singer Ronnie Barron to front the band as the Dr. John character, but Don Costa who managed Barron at the time advised him against it claiming it to be a bad career move. Rebennack took on the Dr. John stage name himself.\n\nGris-Gris was recorded in Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, California. With an album due and no singer prepared, Dr. John managed to book studio time originally reserved for Sonny & Cher.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nGris-Gris was released in 1968 on Atco Records, a sub-label of Atlantic Records. Atlantic exectuve Ahmet Ertegun was reluctant on releasing the record at first, exclaiming ""How can we market this boogaloo crap?"". Gris-Gris failed to chart in the United States and United Kingdom. Modern reception of the album has been very positive. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic gave the album five out of five stars, referring to it as ""The most exploratory and psychedelic outing of Dr. John\'s career"". In 1999, Tom Moon of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, with a rating of four stars out of five. In 2003, the album was ranked number 143 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John,+the+Night+Tripper/Gris-Gris"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A remastered version was released in 2005.\n\nGoo was the first album released after the band signed to major label Geffen Records. Their albums became more accessible and less experimental, but still retained elements of a trademark collage of noise. Many songs on Goo start and end abruptly; a departure from Daydream Nation which was known for its long, psychedelic guitar intros and outros.\n\nSongs\n\nThe album\'s lead track, ""Dirty Boots"", evokes old blues slang in its declaration that ""It\'s time to rock the road/And tell the story of the jelly rollin\'/Dirty boots are on/Hi de ho.""\n\nThe second track, ""Tunic (Song for Karen)"", is about Karen Carpenter, a female rock drummer who died from anorexia nervosa. It imagines her in heaven, happy, playing the drums again and meeting new friends Dennis Wilson, Elvis Presley and Janis Joplin.\n\nThe album featured the single ""Kool Thing"", on which Chuck D from the rap group Public Enemy guested. The song is purported to be about the disillusionment that Gordon experienced after interviewing LL Cool J for Spin Magazine the previous year. ""Are you going to liberate us girls from male, white, corporate oppression?"" Gordon asks in the song, but receives only hipster gibberish in return. ""Kool Thing"" became the song that many casual music fans associate with the band. The album version of ""Mary-Christ"" fades out with a portion of the intro to ""Kool Thing"". This is because in the recording session for ""Mary-Christ"" the band went right into ""Kool Thing"", but this take of ""Kool Thing"" was not chosen for the album.\n\nThe album\'s title derives from the song ""My Friend Goo"", a portrait of a friend who ""sticks just like glue.""\n\nCover\n\nThe cover is a Raymond Pettibon illustration based on a paparazzi photo of Maureen Hindley and her first husband David Smith, witnesses in the case of the ""Moors Murders"" serial killers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, driving to the trial in 1966.\n\nThe handwritten text reads, ""I stole my sister\'s boyfriend. It was all whirlwind, heat, and flash. Within a week we killed my parents and hit the road.""\n\nVideo\n\nIn 1991, a long-form music video version of Goo was released on VHS. A music video for each song from the album is included; the track listing is identical to the ""original release"" list above. In 2004, nearly the entire contents of the Goo video was included on the DVD compilation Corporate Ghost: The Videos: 1990-2002; only a short fragment that appeared after the conclusion of ""Titanium Exposé"" on the 1991 video is missing. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Goo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein\'s album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\n\nProduction began at London\'s Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie\'s Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album\'s worth of extra material, most of which remains unreleased.\n\nAll Things Must Pass was critically acclaimed on release and, with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world, commercially successful. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter\'s Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as ""Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons"". Reflecting the general surprise at the assuredness of Harrison\'s post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker\'s Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo\'s first role in a talking picture and declared: ""Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!"" Several critics consider All Things Must Pass to be the best of all the Beatles\' solo albums.\n\nIn March 2001, following a successful reissue campaign coinciding with its 30th anniversary, the album was certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2012, Rolling Stone placed All Things Must Pass 433rd on its list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n\nA1. I\'d Have You Anytime - 3:00\nA2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\nA3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\nA4. Isn\'t It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\nB1. What Is Life - 4:27\nB2. If Not for You - 3:33\nB3. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\nB4.

All Things Must Pass - 2:47\nD1. I Dig Love - 4:59\nD2. Art of Dying - 3:42\nD3. Isn\'t It a Pity (version two) - 4:50\nD4. Hear Me Lord - 5:51\nE1. Out of the Blue - 11:17\nE2. It\'s Johnny\'s Birthday - 0:50\nE3. Plug Me In - 3:20\nF1. I Remember Jeep - 8:09\nF2. Thanks for the Pepperoni - 5:32\n\nThe remaster from 2001 moved ""Out of the Blue"" to the end of the album and inserted five bonus tracks after the first LP. The insertion of the bonus tracks into the middle of the album\'s running order was regarded as an unwelcome addition to the album, particularly since there was enough space to include the album\'s first two LPs on the first CD and the last LP with the bonus tracks on the second. The running order on this edition is as follows:\n\nDisc 1:\n1. I\'d Have You Anytime - 3:00\n2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\n3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\n4. Isn\'t It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\n5. What Is Life - 4:27\n6. If Not for You - 3:33\n7. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\n8. Let It Down - 5:01\n9. Run of the Mill - 2:53\n10. I Live for You - 3:35\n11. Beware of Darkness (acoustic demo) - 3:19\n12. Let It Down (alternate version) - 3:54\n13. What Is Life (backing track/alternate mix) - 4:27\n14. My Sweet Lord (2000) - 4:57\n\nDisc 2:\n1.

It’s understandable given that both were teenagers at the time.\n\nBesides, if it was the impetus for what was to come, then it was definitely a good thing. While only producing three songs on Juvenile Hell, the group produced a majority of The infamous, carving out a unique and unmistakable sound. Dark, moody, brooding, and sinister, the music was apocalyptic and Havoc and Prodigy’s unyielding and unremorseful lyrics painted a very bleak picture of what life was like growing up in Queensbridge (yeah, we know Prodigy is from Hempstead, Long Island, but it’s obvious he spent a lot of time in QB). It may have been unnerving to think that a duo so young could entertain such cold-blooded thoughts, but given the overwhelmingly positive response, the realness seemed to resonate.\n\nThe album contained huge smashes with “Shook Ones, Pt.

Despite their newfound success, the album was a modest hit reaching only number 60, though the single Down On Me nearly broke the Top 40. Columbia Records offered the band a new recording contract, but it took months to get through since they were still signed to Mainstream Records. By early 1968, they began work on what was the most eagerly anticipated record of the year. The album features three cover songs (""Summertime,"" ""Piece of My Heart,"" ""Ball and Chain""). The album also features Bill Graham who introduces the band at the beginning of ""Combination of the Two"". ""Combination of the Two,"" ""I Need A Man To Love,"" and the nearly ten-minute ""Ball And Chain"" are the only live recordings. The album\'s overall raw sound effectively captures the band\'s energetic and lively concerts.\n\nThe cover was drawn by underground cartoonist Robert Crumb after the band\'s original cover idea, a picture of the group naked in bed together, was dropped by the record company. The cover was originally meant to be the record\'s back picture but the band did not like Crumb\'s original front drawing. It is number nine on Rolling Stone\'s list of one hundred greatest album covers.\n\nInitially, the album was to be called Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills, but the title was not received well by Columbia Records.\n\nA variation of the title on the cover is used as the logo for the Cheap Thrills record label, owned by British DJ Hervé.\n\nThe album was released in the summer of 1968, one year after their debut album, and reached number one on the Billboard charts in its eighth week in October. It kept the number one spot for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks while the single, ""Piece of My Heart,"" also became a huge hit. By the end of the year it was the most successful album of 1968, having sold nearly a million copies. The success was short-lived however, as Janis Joplin left the group for a solo career in December, 1968. In 2003, the album was ranked number 338 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They previously ranked it #50 on their Top 100 Albums of the Past 20 Years list in 1987. It is often regarded as one of the key recordings of the late 1960s.\n\nOuttakes originally to have appeared on the album have since been released on Janis Joplin compilations such as Farewell Song (In which Big Brother\'s original instruments were replaced with studio musicians from 1983, angering the band) and the Janis compilation box set featuring all original studio songs and live recordings. The 1999 re-release of Cheap Thrills features the outtakes ""Flower in the Sun"" and ""Roadblock"" as well as live performances of ""Magic of Love"" and ""Catch Me Daddy"" as bonus material. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Brother+&+The+Holding+Company/Cheap+Thrills"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album helped to propel Green Day into mainstream popularity, amid claims from the punk rock community that the band had ""sold out"".\n\nDookie produced five singles for the band: ""Longview"", the re-recorded ""Welcome to Paradise"", ""Basket Case"", the radio-only single ""She"" and ""When I Come Around"". As of 2008, Dookie is the band\'s best-selling album, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide. Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1995.\n\nFollowing the underground success of the band\'s second album Kerplunk (1992), a number of major labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo ""was the only person we could really talk to and connect with"".\n\nEventually, the band left their independent record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing to a major label caused many of the band\'s original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, ""I couldn\'t go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure  The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.""\n\nRob Cavallo was chosen as the main producer of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home he sensed that ""had stumbled on something big."" The band\'s recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, ""Similar to the Sex Pistols\' album or first Black Sabbath albums."" The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed, at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, ""Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it.""\n\nMuch of the album\'s content was written by Armstrong, except ""Emenius Sleepus"" which was co-written by Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt, and the hidden track, ""All By Myself"", which was composed and written by drummer Tré Cool. The album touched upon various experiences of the band members and included subjects like anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom, and former girlfriends.\n\nThe single ""Longview"" had a signature bass line that bass player Dirnt wrote while under the influence of LSD. He originally forgot much of it, but the remembered portions were included in the song. Armstrong stated that the song was mainly about boredom, masturbation, and smoking cannabis, as evident in some of the lyrics (""When masturbation\'s lost its fun/You\'re fucking breaking"").\n\t\n\n""Welcome to Paradise"", the second single from Dookie, was originally on the second studio album by the band, Kerplunk. The song was re-recorded, with a less grainy sound for Dookie. The song never had an official music video, however, a certain live performance of the song is often associated as a music video. The video is located on Green Day\'s official website.\n\nThe radio-only single, ""She"", was written by Armstrong about a former girlfriend who showed him a feminist poem with an identical title. In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of ""She"" and showed them to her. She later moved to Ecuador, prompting Armstrong to put ""She"" on the album. The same ex-girlfriend is the topic of the songs ""Sassafras Roots"" and ""Chump"".\n\nAnother song, ""Coming Clean"", deals with Armstrong\'s coming to terms with his bisexuality when he was 16 and 17 years old. In his interview with The Advocate magazine, he says that although he has never had a relationship with a man, his sexuality has been ""something that comes up as a struggle in me"".\n\nThe hit single ""Basket Case"", which appeared on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong\'s personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong\'s anxiety attacks and feelings of ""going crazy"" prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution.\n\nThe final single, ""When I Come Around"", was again inspired by a woman, though this time being about Armstrong\'s wife, then former girlfriend, Adrienne. Following a dispute between the couple, Armstrong left Adrienne to spend some time alone. The video featured the three band members walking around Berkeley and San Francisco at night, eventually ending up back at the original location. Future touring back up guitarist, Jason White, made a cameo in the video with his then-girlfriend.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong wrote the song ""In The End"" about his mother and her boyfriend (similar to Why Do You Want Him). He is quoted saying: ""That song is about my mother\'s husband, it\'s not really about a girl, or like anyone directly related to me in a relationship. In the End\'s about my mother.""\n\n Album name and art\n\nThe name of the album is a reference to the band members often suffering from diarrhea, which they referred to as ""liquid dookie"", as a result of eating spoiled food whilst on tour. Initially the band were to name the album ""Liquid Dookie"", however this was deemed ""too gross"", and so they settled on the name ""Dookie"".\n\nThe cover art is an illustration by Richie Bucher, which depicts bombs being dropped on people and buildings. In the center, there is an explosion, with the band\'s name at the top. Armstrong has since explained the meaning of the artwork:\n“ \tI wanted the art work to look really different. I wanted it to represent the East Bay and where we come from, because there\'s a lot of artists in the East Bay scene that are just as important as the music. So we talked to Richie Bucher. He did a 7-inch cover for this band called Raooul that I really liked. He\'s also been playing in bands in the East Bay for years. There\'s pieces of us buried on the album cover. There\'s one guy with his camera up in the air taking a picture with a beard. He took pictures of bands every weekend at Gilman\'s. The robed character that looks like Ozzy Osbourne is the woman on the cover of the first Ozzy album. Angus Young is in there somewhere too. The graffiti reading ""Twisted Dog Sisters"" refers to these two girls from Berkeley. I think the guy saying ""The fritter, fat boy"" was a reference to a local cop. \t”\n\nThe back cover on early prints of the CD featured a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child\'s lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.\n\nUpon its release, Dookie charted in seven countries. The album peaked at number two on Billboard 200 in the United States, and was a success in several other countries, peaking as high as number one in New Zealand; the lowest peak in any country was in the United Kingdom at number 13. While all the singles from the album charted in a few countries, the hit single ""Basket Case"" entered the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Later in 1995, the album received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, with ""Longview"" and ""Basket Case"" both being nominated for a Grammy.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Dookie continued to sell well, eventually receiving diamond certification in 1999; To date, Dookie has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and remains the band\'s best-selling album.\n\nOn April 18, 2009 Dookie was reissued on 180 gram vinyl for the 2nd annual \'Record Store Day\'.\n\nThe album was well received by some critics, with Allmusic describing Dookie as ""a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered"". In 1994, Time claimed Dookie as the third best album of the year, but the best rock album of 1994. The New York Times, in early 1995, described the sound of Dookie as, ""Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate.""\n\nHowever, many other music critics, and even some other mainstream bands, claimed the band had sold out for signing to a major label, and called them ""watered down punk imposters"". The New York Times, while complementary on the album\'s overall quality, noted that Dookie\'s pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band did not respond initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were ""just trying to be themselves"" and that ""it\'s our band, we can do whatever we want"". Dirnt claimed that the follow up album, Insomniac, one of the band\'s hardest albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism from critics and former fans.\n\nSince its release, Dookie has featured heavily in various ""must have"" lists compiled by the music media.

The album was recorded and mixed at Le Studio, Morin Heights, Quebec.\n\nA classic rock album, Moving Pictures became the band\'s biggest selling album in the U.S., hitting #3, and remains the band\'s most popular studio recording to date (certified quadruple-platinum with four million copies sold on January 27, 1995).\n\nFollowing the formula of their previous album, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures follows a more radio-friendly format and includes the hit single ""Tom Sawyer"", as well as radio standards ""Red Barchetta"" and ""Limelight"".\n\nMoving Pictures was the second Rush album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n\nBackground\nWork on the album began in August 1980 at Stony Lake, Ontario. ""The Camera Eye"" was the first to be written, followed by ""Tom Sawyer,"" ""Red Barchetta,"" ""YYZ"", and ""Limelight."" ""Tom Sawyer"" grew from a melody that Lee had been using to set up his synthesizers at sound checks.\n\nAt Phase One studios with producer Terry Brown, they began recording demos. ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" were polished in October by playing them live on a warm-up tour (although both songs had slightly different arrangements on the album than were played on the tour), and then they started the main recording at Le Studio in Quebec. ""Red Barchetta"" was recorded in one take, while others took many. There were problems with equipment failures and they finished three days behind schedule.\n\nSongs\nWith a title reference to Mark Twain\'s fictional character, ""Tom Sawyer"" is an abstract commentary on a free-thinking ""modern day warrior"". Likely Rush\'s best-selling single, it is also a mainstay in Rush\'s live show. Lyrics for this track were written in collaboration with Max Webster lyricist Pye Dubois.\n\nThe second song on Moving Pictures is ""Red Barchetta"". Lyrics were inspired by the short story ""A Nice Morning Drive"" by Richard S. Foster. Peart, however, has reported that the car that inspired the song\'s title is a Ferrari 166 MM Barchetta.\n\nNext is the Grammy-nominated instrumental ""YYZ"". The track\'s title is the IATA Airport Code for Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is played repeatedly in Morse code (-.--/-.--/--..) at the beginning of the song. A staple within their live-performance repertoire, ""YYZ"" is widely seen as a signature Rush song.\n\n""Limelight"" is another perennial radio favorite. The lyrics are autobiographical, based on Peart\'s own dissatisfactions with fame and its intrusions into personal life. The song contains two self-references: one, the line ""all the world\'s indeed a stage, and we are merely players"", references their live album All the World\'s a Stage (as well as the famous line by William Shakespeare) while the line ""living in a fish-eye lens, caught in the camera eye"" references the next track, ""The Camera Eye"". Alex Lifeson\'s guitar solo on the track is often hailed as one of his finest performances.\n\nSide two of the original vinyl release opened with ""The Camera Eye"", which would be Rush\'s last ""epic"" song, clocking in at almost eleven minutes. Lyrically and musically it is an attempt to capture the energy and moods of two of the English-speaking world\'s great cities: New York (first verse) and London (second verse). Unlike all the other songs on the album it has never been performed live since the Moving Pictures / Exit Stage Left tours of 1981/82 (and even more sparingly played during the Signals tour of 1983). It usually tops internet polls for the song which fans would most like to see the band perform live again. The title and general thematics of ""The Camera Eye"" lyrics were borrowed from the work of John Dos Passos, one of Peart\'s favorite authors.\n\nThe sixth song ""Witch Hunt"" initially features voices (that according to Alex Lifeson on In the Studio with Redbeard, which devoted an episode to Moving Pictures, were recorded outside Le Studio in sub-zero temperatures with the band and crew ranting and raving in a humorous way) and sound effects made by Lee\'s Oberheim keyboards, before jumping into the rock section of the song. It has graphic designer and musician Hugh Syme\'s on keyboards (Rush\'s longtime artwork creator), and the entire drum part was recorded twice in one verse, with a percussion section created by recording each sound differently. ""Witch Hunt"" would become a part of the Fear series of songs, which includes ""The Weapon"" from Signals, ""The Enemy Within"" from Grace Under Pressure, and ""Freeze"" from Vapor Trails.\n\nRounding out the album is ""Vital Signs"", which starts off with a distinctive sequencer part made by Lee\'s OB-X synthesizer, shows distinct reggae flavor—the experimentation with which was likely inspired by The Police. Reggae influences would later creep into tracks found on the band\'s next studio release Signals.\n\n""Tom Sawyer"" (Lifeson, Lee, Peart, Pye Dubois) – 4:33 \n""Red Barchetta"" – 6:06 \n""YYZ"" (Lee, Peart) – 4:24 \n""Limelight"" – 4:19 \n""The Camera Eye"" – 10:56 \n""Witch Hunt (Part III of Fear)"" – 4:43 \n""Vital Signs"" – 4:43 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - Bass guitar; Minimoog; Oberheim polyphonic; OB-X, Taurus pedal synthesizer, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - Electric and Acoustic Guitars, Taurus pedals \nNeil Peart - drums, timbales, gong bass drums, orchestra bells, glockenspiel, tubular bells, wind chimes, cowbells, bell tree, crotales, plywood \nPaul Northfield - Engineer \nHugh Syme - guest appearance playing synthesizers on ""Witch Hunt"", art direction, cover concept and design. \nDeborah Samuel - photography \nRobbie Whelan - assistant engineer \nBob Ludwig - mastering and remastering \nPeter Jensen - digital mastering and editing \nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1981 Billboard\'s Pop Albums 3 \n\n\nSingles\nInformation \n""Limelight"" \nReleased: February 1981 \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: #55 US Hot 100; #4 US Mainstream Rock \n \n""Tom Sawyer"" \nReleased: October 1981 \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart & Pye Dubois \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: #44 US Hot 100; #1 US Mainstream Rock \n \n""Vital Signs"" \nReleased: March 1981 \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \n \n \nThe Ontario Legislature, circa 2006The album cover is a monument to triple entendre. On the front cover there are movers who are moving pictures. Then there are people crying because the pictures passed by are emotionally ""Moving"". Finally, the back cover has a film crew making a ""moving picture"" of the whole scene.\nThe album cover was taken in front of the Ontario Legislature Building at Queen\'s Park. \nThe first pressings of Moving Pictures on compact disc were missing the first beat of ""Tom Sawyer"" by mistake. This was corrected in subsequent CD releases. \nRemaster Details\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs issued a Gold CD remaster in 1992. That release is now out of print.\n\nA Mercury Records remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of three fingerprints, light blue, pink, and lime green (left to right) with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Moving Pictures through to A Show Of Hands feature this logo, originally found on the cover art of Retrospective II. \nThe remastered CD restores all of the original vinyl artwork including the lyrics plus the moving picture of drummer Neil Peart which was missing on the original CD issue. \n\n""Moving Pictures"" in popular culture\nThe album was confirmed for download for the video game, Rock Band, on August 26, 2008. The songs Tom Sawyer and Limelight were already available in the game before this release, however, the new album download uses the songs\' original master tracks as opposed to cover versions recorded specifically for the game. However, the release was delayed due to technical difficulties.\n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Moving+Pictures"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Like the group\'s previous two albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and produced by primary member Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker also mixed the music. It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.\n\nAfter releasing the group\'s previous record, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on Currents, largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and owing to his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project\'s prior work, Currents marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala\'s music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album\'s cover art depicting vortex shedding is a visualization of these themes.\n\nCurrents was preceded by the singles Let It Happen, Cause I\'m a Man, Disciples and Eventually. Like its predecessors, the album received critical acclaim. It became the group\'s best charting release, debuting at number one in Australia, number three in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, Currents was awarded ""Best Rock Album"" and ""Album of the Year"", among other honors that Tame Impala received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Currents"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It spawned four singles: Risingson, Teardrop, Angel, and Inertia Creeps.\n\nBackground\nThe production of Mezzanine was a stressful process. With tensions arising within the group, it almost split the band. They disagreed about the musical direction for the new material. Robert Del Naja first started making samples from new wave records, from the likes of Wire and Gang of Four: it was the music he\'d listened to in his early teens. Del Naja wanted Massive Attack to make an album having an atmosphere of edginess and paranoia present in the music of the late 1970s. Grant Marshall, also a new wave fan himself, supported this idea, as he wanted to get away from the ""urban soul"" of their previous work, Protection, but Andrew Vowles was sceptical. The sessions continued with Vowles and Marshall working on bass and drum loops, while Del Naja carried on experimenting from new wave records. However, during the recording, the group decided to release a new track, Superpredators sampling extensively a Siouxsie and the Banshees\' song called Metal Postcard, for the movie soundtrack of The Jackal; the track would be included on the Japanese version of Mezzanine.\n\nThe album was initially meant to be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio ""making tracks, tearing them apart, fucking  them up, panicking, then starting again."" The album\'s working title was Damaged Goods, which was the name of the Gang of Four\'s 1978 debut single.\n\nComposition\nMezzanine has been described as featuring trip hop and electronica, with a ""dark claustrophobia"" coupled with a melancholy. Musically, the album is a major departure from the jazzy and laidback sound of the first two albums, Blue Lines and Protection, invoking the dark undercurrents which had always been present in the collective\'s music. The album\'s textured and deep tone relies heavily on abstract and ambient sounds, as demonstrated in the song Angel among others.\n\nSimilar to their previous albums, several songs use one or more samples, ranging from Isaac Hayes to The Cure. In 1998, Manfred Mann sued Massive Attack for unauthorised use of a sample of the song Tribute from Manfred Mann\'s Earth Band\'s eponymous 1972 album, used on Black Milk. The song has subsequently appeared as Black Melt on later releases and at live performances, with the sample removed. Later digital editions of Mezzanine have retained the original song, with Mann being added to the songwriting credits.\n\nMezzanine marked the parting of band member Vowles, due to creative conflicts. Reggae artist Horace Andy also performed several spots on the album.\n\nReception\nMezzanine entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 4 September 1998 and then double platinum on 22 July 2013. However, it failed to share the same success in North America, peaking at number 60 on the Billboard 200 and number 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nThe album received significant critical acclaim, which praised the collective\'s new sound. Rolling Stone\'s Barney Hoskyns, although praising the album, pointed to its flaws: ""Sometimes rhythm and texture are explored at the expense of memorable tunes, and the absence of the bizarre Tricky  only highlights the flat, monotonous rapping of the group\'s 3-D."" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and selected Risingson and Man Next Door as highlights.\n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic also had positive words for the album\'s song Inertia Creeps, saying it could well be the highlight, another feature for just the core threesome. With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.""\n\nYears after the album was released, it was placed on several best-of lists in the UK and the United States. In 2000, Q magazine placed Mezzanine at number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 412 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2013, it was placed at 215 on NME\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAs of 2010, sales in the United States have exceeded 560,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. An instrumental cover version of the song Dissolved Girl was written by composer Ramin Djawadi for Westworld season 3, who previously worked with Neil Davidge for Clash of the Titans 2010 film soundtrack.\n\nMezzanine DNA\nOn the 20th anniversary of Mezzanine\'s release, the record was encoded into synthetic DNA—a first for an album. The project was in collaboration with TurboBeads Labs in Switzerland; the digital audio of the album was stored in the form of genetic information. The audio was then compressed using Opus, coded in DNA molecules—with 920,000 short DNA strands containing all the data—and then poured into 5,000 tiny glass beads.\n\n20th anniversary reissue\nThe album was remastered and reissued for its 20th anniversary. The 2CD anniversary edition was released on 23 August 2019, and comes with a bonus disc of previously unreleased dub mixes by the Mad Professor, which were originally intended to be released on a Mezzanine remix album. A triple-LP vinyl version was also slated to be released; initially delayed from its proposed release date, the 3LP version was eventually canceled altogether.\n\nIn lieu of the vinyl reissue, the Mad Professor remixes were released as a pink-coloured 12"" vinyl single entitled Massive Attack v Mad Professor Part II (Mezzanine Remix Tapes \'98) on 20 September 2019.\n\nThe Mad Professor remixes include Metal Banshee (an unreleased dub version of Superpredators, which was a reworked cover of Metal Postcard originally by Siouxsie and the Banshees), and Wire, a track recorded for the soundtrack to the film Welcome to Sarajevo. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/Mezzanine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In Rainbows was Radiohead\'s first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\nIn Rainbows was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead\'s other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as his attempt to write ""seduction songs"".\n\n Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one.

It takes its title from the Nina Simone song ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black.""\n\nIt\'s nearly impossible to single out any of Aretha Franklin\'s early-\'70s albums for Atlantic as being her best, particularly given the breadth of her output during this era. In terms of albums rather than singles, it\'s probably her strongest era, and if you count live albums like Amazing Grace, choosing a standout or a favorite record isn\'t any easier. Yet of this stunning era, Young, Gifted and Black certainly ranks highly among her studio efforts, with many arguing that it may be her greatest. And with songs like ""Rock Steady,"" that may be a valid argument. But there\'s much more here than just a few highlights. If you really want to go song by song, you\'d be hard-pressed to find any throwaways here -- this is quite honestly an album that merits play from beginning to end. You have upbeat songs like the aforementioned ""Rock Steady"" that will get you up out of your seat moving and grooving, yet then you also have a number of more introspective songs that slow down the tempo and are more likely to relax than rouse. And if that wide spectrum of moods isn\'t enough reason to celebrate this album, you get some unlikely songs like a take on ""The Long and Winding Road."" Plus, you also have to keep in mind that Franklin was in her prime here, not only in terms of voice but also in terms of confidence -- you can just feel her exuding her status as the best of the best. Furthermore, her ensemble of musicians competes with any that she had worked with on previous albums. So even if this isn\'t the greatest Aretha Franklin album of the early \'70s, it\'s certainly a contender, the sort of album that you can\'t go wrong with.\n\nthe chronological order of the last.fm track listing  is totally wrong. \nThis is the correct one:\n\nTrack listing \n1. \t""Oh Me Oh My (I\'m a Fool for You Baby)"" (Jim Doris) \t3:42\n2. \t""Day Dreaming"" (Franklin) \t4:00\n3. \t""Rock Steady"" (Franklin) \t3:15\n4. \t""Young, Gifted and Black"" (Nina Simone) \t3:34\n5. \t""All the King\'s Horses"" (Franklin) \t3:56\n6. \t""A Brand New Me"" (Theresa Bell, Jerry Butler, Kenny Gamble) \t4:26\n7. \t""April Fools"" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) \t3:29\n8. \t""I\'ve Been Loving You Too Long"" (Jerry Butler, Otis Redding) \t3:36\n9. \t""First Snow in Kokomo"" (Franklin) \t4:04\n10. \t""The Long and Winding Road"" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) \t3:38\n11. \t""Didn\'t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)"" (Thom Bell, William Hart) \t3:42\n12. \t""Border Song (Holy Moses)"" (Bernie Taupin, Elton John) \t3:22\n\nPersonnel \n    Dr. John - Percussion\n    Aretha Franklin - Piano, Celeste, Electric piano, Vocals\n    Donny Hathaway - Organ, Electric piano\n    Billy Preston - Organ\n    Sammy Turner - Background Vocals\n    Hubert Laws - Alto Flute\n    Chuck Rainey - Bass\n    J.R.

Because of 4AD\'s independent status, distribution in the United States was handled by British label Rough Trade Records; however, it failed to chart in either the UK or the U.S. ""Gigantic"" was the only single taken from the release, and only reached number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite this, Surfer Rosa was re-released in the U.S. by Elektra Records in 1992, and in 2005 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Surfer Rosa is often cited as a favorite of music critics, and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums. Many alternative rock artists, including Billy Corgan and PJ Harvey, have cited the album as inspirational; Nirvana\'s Kurt Cobain frequently acknowledged that Surfer Rosa was a strong influence on Nevermind, and in 1993 hired the album\'s producer Steve Albini to produce his band\'s album In Utero. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Surfer+Rosa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was intended to succeed the group\'s 11th studio album Pet Sounds and was based on the engineering methods of their single ""Good Vibrations"". Many years after the project was shelved due to personal and technical difficulties with recording, Wilson chose to revisit the material with Parks as a specially arranged live concert performance. Motivated by the unexpected positive reception, a studio-recorded version was then released by Wilson as a solo album.\n\nRecorded from scratch, Brian Wilson Presents Smile eschews the Beach Boys\' Smile sessions by containing all-new instrumental and vocal performances. Recordings from the original Beach Boys\' sessions were later released as The Smile Sessions in 2011. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/SMiLE"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Supreme Clientele contains a large amount of production from group member RZA, who also re-worked and remixed beats from other producers involved, as a means to create a unified and cohesive sound for the album.\n\nSupreme Clientele debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while selling 134,000 copies in its first week.  On March 8, 2000, it was certified Gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  The album featured the singles ""Apollo Kids"" and ""Cherchez La Ghost"", which, despite receiving limited airplay, went on to achieve notable chart success. Supreme Clientele gained strong reviews from critics, despite its contrasting sound and style to that of his previous critically successful album Ironman.\n\nSupreme Clientele became the most acclaimed out of all second generation Wu-Tang projects, and featured the most contributions from RZA during this era. It was praised and noted for Ghostface Killah\'s obscure and creative lyrics, and for the cohesive format of production.  Along with Ironman (1996) and FishScale (2006), it is often ranked as Ghostface Killah\'s best work. It has also been regarded as one of the best solo Wu-Tang albums, and has received accolades for being one of the best albums of the 2000s decade.  A sequel entitled Supreme Clientele Presents...

At his request, bandmate Carl Wilson began contributing more to the recording process, a trend that continued on subsequent albums. Mike Love also returned as Brian\'s main songwriting collaborator for the first time since Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (1965). It was the last Beach Boys album to feature Brian as a primary composer until The Beach Boys Love You (1977).\n\nWild Honey was later credited with pioneering DIY pop and with anticipating a back-to-basics trend followed by other acts of the era, including the Beatles. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Wild+Honey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The record shattered traditional concepts of harmony in jazz, getting rid of not only the piano player but the whole idea of concretely outlined chord changes. The pieces here follow almost no predetermined harmonic structure, which allows Coleman and partner Don Cherry an unprecedented freedom to take the melodies of their solo lines wherever they felt like going in the moment, regardless of what the piece\'s tonal center had seemed to be. Plus, this was the first time Coleman recorded with a rhythm section — bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins — that was loose and open-eared enough to follow his already controversial conception. Coleman\'s ideals of freedom in jazz made him a feared radical in some quarters; there was much carping about his music flying off in all directions, with little direct relation to the original theme statements. If only those critics could have known how far out things would get in just a few short years; in hindsight, it\'s hard to see just what the fuss was about, since this is an accessible, frequently swinging record. It\'s true that Coleman\'s piercing, wailing alto squeals and vocalized effects weren\'t much beholden to conventional technique, and that his themes often followed unpredictable courses, and that the group\'s improvisations were very free-associative. But at this point, Coleman\'s desire for freedom was directly related to his sense of melody — which was free-flowing, yes, but still very melodic. Of the individual pieces, the haunting ""Lonely Woman"" is a stone-cold classic, and ""Congeniality"" and ""Peace"" aren\'t far behind. Any understanding of jazz\'s avant-garde should begin here. \n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman/The+Shape+of+Jazz+to+Come"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also released in XRCD2 format in 2000, Super Audio CD format on July 26, 2005 and DualDisc format on August 16, 2005, winning a Grammy for Best Surround Sound Album.\n\nIn 2006, a half-speed-mastered vinyl version of the album was issued. Mastered by the renowned Stan Ricker, this version puts the full-length songs on vinyl for the first time. In order to do this, the album spans four sides on two 33 1/3 rpm discs.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed Brothers in Arms at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In November 2006, the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. Brothers in Arms came in at number 64 (see ""My Favourite Album"").\n\nAs of April 30 2008, Brothers in Arms was 5th on the list of best-selling albums (UK) and is the 107th best-selling album in the United States.\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards.\n\nPersonnel:\nMark Knopfler: guitar, lead vocals\nJohn Illsley: bass, vocals\nAlan Clark: organ, synth, piano\nGuy Fletcher: synth, vocals\nTerry Williams: drums\nAdditional Personnel:\nOmar Hakim: drums\nJack Sonni: guitar\nMichael Brecker: saxophone\nRandy Brecker: horn\nMalcolm Duncan: tenor saxophone\nNeil Jason: bass\nTony Levin: bass\nJimmy Maelen: percussion\nMichael Mainieri: background vocals\nDave Plews: horn\nSting: vocals on Money for Nothing""\n\nReleased 13 May 1985\nRecorded November 1984 - March 1985 AIR Studios, Montserrat\nAIR Studios, London - Power Station, New York\nLength 55:07 (CD)\n47:21 (LP)\nLabel Vertigo (UK), Warner Bros.

Confessions showcases the vocals of Usher as a crooner. A R&B-centered album, it also encompasses musical genres such as hip hop and crunk. The album\'s themes generated controversy about Usher\'s personal relationship; however, the album\'s primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the record reflects his personal story.\n\nConfessions was an instant commercial success in the United States, selling 1.1 million copies in its debut, the most copies ever sold in a week by an R&B recording artist. The album\'s continued success was bolstered by its four chart-topping singles. As a strategy to boost its sales amid threats of bootlegging, a special edition of the album was issued featuring the hit single ""My Boo"". Although it received criticism for its lyrical quality, Confessions received generally positive reviews and earned Usher several awards. In 2005, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album. The success of the album put Usher in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of 2004. Confessions has sold over 10 million copies in the United States, and has been certified diamond in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album has gone platinum and gold in over twenty other countries, and has sold nearly 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nUsher did not think of collaborating with many new record producers to handle Confessions. With the production started in 2003, he opted to continue creating music with Jermaine Dupri, who produced his last two albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher contacted a few new producers as well: ""With this album I choose some new producers who I figured would definitely allow me to really articulate myself in a different way ... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta look for something different."" Dupri also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox. The album features productions by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, The Neptunes, Just Blaze, R. Kelly, and Usher\'s brother James Lackey.\n\nWith forty recorded songs, Usher felt the album had already been completed. Initially, he submitted the album to his record label, Arista. He and the company\'s then-president, L.A. Reid, listened to the record; however, they thought something was missing in it: ""You know what, there\'s like one or two more records that we just gotta get."" Usher was displeased with the decision: He felt returning to the studio was the hardest part and needed to re-motivated himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from fellow Atlantians Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the team was able to produce songs like ""Red Light"" and ""Yeah!"". He also recorded songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions but were not released.\n\nOne of Usher\'s first steps in making Confessions was deciding to reveal ""his own little secrets"". Friend and former A&R rep Kawan ""KP"" Prather thought that it would let the public know Usher personally: ""The music has never been the question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they\'re there with you."" Primarily because of its personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: ""All of us have our Pandora\'s boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I\'ve got a lot to say. I\'ve got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of."" He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.\n\nSeveral of the songs in the album were conceptually based from a situation. For instance, ""Burn"" was built around a situation where Usher\'s two-year relationship with Rozonda ""Chilli"" Thomas of American R&B-hip hop girl group TLC was about to end. Dupri and Cox were talking and felt that there is a song in it, and started writing. Same through with the supposedly title track ""Confessions Part II""; they were conversing about an impregnated a mistress, and its concept was written down. Usher was recording ""Confessions Part II"" on a July 2003 session in New York City, United States. With Usher singing the song\'s lyrics, the theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri; both decided to produce two parts: ""Confessions Part I"" and ""Confessions Part II (the former is heard at the beginning of the video for the latter).\n\nConfessions is dominantly in the R&B genre. Usher commented that he chose to work with collaborators who know ""... how to interpret R&B from a jazz standpoint, an old school throwback standpoint, a new school point, a traditional classic standpoint ..."" With producers and him set to produce such album, however, other types of genres including hip hop are incorporated. While he wanted to do R&B, Usher also wanted his fans to experience hip hop and at the same time R&B: ""I try to think outside the box."" When Lil Jon came in the scene, crunk was introduced to the R&B-centered album, specifically on the song ""Yeah!"". Usher said, ""\'Yeah!\' could be called the first consciously styled ""crunk R&B"" record."" The album also houses various slow jams.\n\nIt also introduces a new style for Usher, focusing on his voice and technique. Andre ""Dre"" Harris and Vidal Davis listened to 8701 and felt that ""Usher really needs to sing hard and let people know his vocal ability"". With efforts focused on the record to demonstrate his vocal ability to listeners, songs such as ""Superstar"" and ""Follow Me"" exhibited Usher in a type of ""crooner mode"". The ballad-oriented ""Burn"" also showcases his vocal aptitude.\n\nWith sales of more than eight million in 2004, Confessions is named in the United States the most-shipped album of the year. Along with the success of the American singer Norah Jones\'s second album, Feels like Home (2004), as well as breakthroughs albums by many new and old artists, it was seen as a sign that US record sales were slowly recovering after three straight years of decline due to competing DVDs and video games and the prevalent music piracy. By the end of 2004, the industry had sold 667 million albums, an increase of about 1.6 percent, as recorded by Nielsen SoundScan. Compared with sales records in 2003, the figures showed eight percent increase.\n\nThe public speculated that 2004 was the year of Usher. The success of the album put Usher in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of 2004. Others also said that Usher might be the successor of Michael Jackson. The success of the album had also facilitated Usher to branch out to non-musical ventures. He has opened a restaurant, starred in a film, launched his record label and recruited artists, and has done philanthropic activities like his efforts in helping 2005 Hurricane Katrina victims. Usher was not the only person who benefited from the album\'s significant critical and commercial success. Bryan-Michael Cox, who co-wrote and co-produced ""Burn"", earned credibility in the music industry for his role in the album. Cox had been producing records for several notable American artists, including Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny\'s Child, among others, but he considered ""Burn"" as his crowning moment, which earned him two Grammy Award nominations. With 2004 deemed to be his introduction to a larger, more mainstream audience, Cox stated in an interview for MTV that many people were starting to recount what he had done. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Usher/Confessions"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Featuring songs by the duo, it was most famous for containing the video for ""Always on My Mind"" (starring Joss Ackland as a blind priest), which - while not on Actually - was released as a single during this period.\n\nThe period from Actually to Introspective is considered the bands imperial phase, a term now in common usage, by both fans and the Pet Shop Boys themselves.\n\nActually was re-released in 2001 (as were most of the group\'s albums up to that point) as Actually/Further Listening 1987-1988. The re-released version was not only digitally remastered but came with a second disc of B-sides, remixes done by the Pet Shop Boys and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album\'s original release. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pet+Shop+Boys/Actually"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album won the 1997 Soul Train award for Rap Album of the Year posthumously. Shakur also won the award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 23, 2014, eighteen years after Shakur\'s death, with shipments of over 5 million copies (each disc in the double album counted as a separate unit for certification).\n\nIn October 1995, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine paid the $1.4 million bail necessary to get Shakur released from jail on charges of sexual abuse. At the time, Shakur was broke and thus unable to make bail himself. All Eyez on Me was released following an agreement between Knight and Shakur which stated Shakur would make three albums under Death Row Records in return for them paying his bail. Fulfilling part of Shakur\'s brand new contract, this double-album served as the first two albums of his three-album contract.\n\nEuthanasia was the initial title of the album until it was changed to All Eyez on Me during the recording process. Shakur explained to MTV\'s Bill Bellamy in December 1995 saying: “It\'s called All Eyez on Me. That\'s how I feel it is. I got the police watching me, the Feds. I got the females that want to charge me with false charges and sue me and all that. I got the females that like me. I got the jealous homeboys and I got the homies that roll with me. Everybody\'s looking to see what I\'mma do now so All Eyez on Me.”\n\nAll Eyez on Me was originally intended for a Christmas 1995 release but was pushed back as Shakur continued to record music and shoot music videos for the album.\n\nThe album features guest spots from 2Pac\'s regulars, such as former-Thug Life members and The Outlawz, as well as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, and George Clinton, Rappin\' 4-Tay, The Click, Method Man, and Redman among others. The song ""Heartz of Men"" samples a portion of Richard Pryor\'s comedy album That Nigger\'s Crazy. Most of the album was produced by Johnny ""J"" and Daz Dillinger, with help from Dr. Dre on the songs ""California Love"", which he himself appeared in also as an album guest spot, and ""Can\'t C Me"", which was Clinton\'s appearance. DJ Quik also produced, mixed and made an appearance on the album, but had to use his real name on the credits because his contract with Profile Records prevented him from using his stage name.\n\nThe songs on All Eyez on Me are, in general, unapologetic celebrations of living the ""Thug Lifestyle"". Though there is the occasional reminiscence about past and present friends, it is a definite move away from the social and political consciousness of 2Pacalypse Now and Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.... The songs on the album along with the name of the album itself, allude to the feeling of being watched. With songs like ""Can\'t C Me"" and ""All Eyez on Me"", 2Pac makes it known that he feels the presence of surveillance, most notably by the police. The album also references the fact that 2Pac is under the attention of many fans, being his fourth studio album.\n\nThe first single, ""California Love"" featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman was released, December 3, 1995. This is perhaps 2Pac\'s best-known song and his most successful, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks (as a double A-side single with ""How Do U Want It"") and 12 weeks at number one in New Zealand. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award as a Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman) in 1997. A remix version also produced by Dr. Dre appeared on the album. The song has since been certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n""2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" featuring rapper Snoop Dogg, was released as the second single on, May 7, 1996. The video was directed by one of 2Pac\'s production partners, Gobi M. Rahimi and was filmed four months prior to the September 1996 shooting of 2Pac. The prelude for the song shows a parody of Biggie Smalls (""Piggie"") and Puff Daddy (""Buff Daddy"") in discussion with Shakur about the November 1994 shooting. The beginning of the scene where Tupac is speaking to Biggie is in reference to the movie Scarface where Tony speaks to his alleged killer before shooting him. The song peaked at number 46 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.\n\nThe third single, ""How Do U Want It"" featuring R&B duo K-Ci & JoJo, was released, June 4, 1996. It was a Double A-side single to ""California Love"" in America. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. There were three videos filmed for the song: two in the same set for the single in April 1996. The video was directed by Ron Hightower and produced by Tracy D. Robinson. These two are distinguished by MPAA rating (one is certified adult material). The video portrays a wild sex party with jacuzzi, mechanical bull riding, cage dancing and pole stripping. All actors and actresses are dressed in renaissance-age costumes, though all clothes are removed for the nude clip. The adult-material video also features numerous porn stars, including Nina Hartley, Heather Hunter, and Angel Kelly. The limousine segment seen in the clean version is the same except no nudity. The third one is the concert version, mostly them performing on stage. There are cameo appearances by K-Ci & JoJo, and fellow group member of Digital Underground Shock G both in the concert and studio segments.\n\n""I Ain\'t Mad at Cha"" featuring singer Danny Boy, was released shortly after Shakur\'s death as the final single from the album, on September 15, 1996. For the video the song was re-recorded with a live band. The new track was recorded at Can-Am Studios by Conley Abrams. The video was shot weeks before Shakur\'s death.\n\nAll Eyez on Me received widespread critical acclaim. Spin magazine gave it 7 out of 10 and said: ""As long as you don\'t expect philanthropy from Tupac, you\'ll find honesty and some pleasurably twisted scenarios."" The record ranked No. 3 on Entertainment Weekly\'s list of Top 10 albums of 1996. AllMusic stated, ""Maybe it was his time in prison, or maybe it was simply his signing with Suge Knight\'s Death Row label. Whatever the case, 2Pac re-emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it\'s also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of Me Against the World. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they\'re much more romanticized this time around. Despite some undeniable filler, it is easily the best production 2Pac\'s ever had on record"".\n\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Cheo Hodari Coker praised the album: ""All Eyez on Me, a 27-song, 133-minute gangster\'s paradise, finds the rapper even more venomous than he was before his 11-month incarceration for sexual abuse. He displays no remorse for his tough life, and even less feeling for his enemies. The only thing jail time did for 2Pac was make his creative fires burn even hotter—he raps here with a passion and skill matched in gangsta rap only by Snoop Doggy Dogg and the Notorious B.I.G. And with such producers as DJ Pooh, DJ Quik, Dr. Dre and Johnny J laying down the tracks, he finally has a musical team worthy of his talent.""\n\n""It\'s like a Cali thug-life version of Pink Floyd\'s The Wall – pure gangsta ego run amok over two CDs,"" complained Rolling Stone. ""At that length, the album\'s all-hard-all-the-time tone approaches caricature."" Nonetheless, the album was included in the magazine\'s essential recordings of the 1990s.\n\nAll Eyez on Me debuted at number-one on both the US Billboard 200 and the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, selling 566,000 copies in its first week, becoming 2Pac\'s second number one album on the chart. The album was eventually certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of September 2011, All Eyez on Me has shipped 5,887,630 in the United States, making it 2Pac\'s highest selling album.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the British Phonographic Industry certified the album was certified Silver on January 1, 1997, followed by Gold on July 22, 2013, and Platinum on November 14, 2014, for sales of over 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It has charted on Billboard 200 for 105 weeks in total.\n\nIt was re-released in 2001 as enhanced CDs containing the ""California Love"" music video. Both discs contained the same data track. It was also re-released as a Dual-Disc in 2005.\n\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/All+Eyez+on+Me"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1998 Q magazine readers voted it the 27th greatest album of all time.\n\nThe album was a massive departure from the band\'s early indie rock sound, drawing inspiration from the house music scene (and associated drugs) that was becoming popular at the time of its production. The band enlisted house DJs Andrew Weatherall and Terry Farley on producing duties, although the album also contained a wide range of other influences including gospel and dub.\n\nThe album\'s title track did not appear on the album itself; the ten minute dance track was also produced by Andrew Weatherall and sung by Denise Johnson. It appears on the Dixie Narco EP released in 1992, and featured in the opening credits of the now rare Screamadelica VHS video tape.\n\nThe album includes ""Loaded"", which was a top twenty hit single in the UK. Dance DJ Andrew Weatherall began remixing ""I\'m Losing More than I\'ll Ever Have"", from their previous album, and the resulting track disassembled the song, adding a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell\'s ""What I Am"", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson\'s ""Terraplane Blues"" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The single ""Movin\' On Up"" was the band\'s breakthrough hit in the United States, reaching #2 on the Modern Rock Tracks, and also making #28 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nThe album cover for Screamadelica was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of ""Classic Album Cover"" postage stamps issued in January 2010.\n\nA number of samples were used in the production of the album:\n\n    * ""Come Together"" opens with part of a speech given by Jesse Jackson at the Wattstax concert held in Los Angeles in 1972.\n    * ""Loaded"" features lines spoken by Peter Fonda\'s character in the 1966 movie The Wild Angels a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell\'s ""What I Am"".\n    * ""Slip Inside This House"" features Sly Stone\'s laugh from the end of the song ""Sex Machine"" (Stand! - 1969) and the Amen break.\n    * ""Inner Flight"" samples the closing sound on Brian Eno\'s ""The Great Pretender"" from the album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).\n    * ""Higher than the Sun"" uses a sample from ""Wah Wah Man"" by the Young-Holt Unlimited Trio.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Scream/Screamadelica"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album\'s title refers to ""blacking out negativity and embracing life fully"".  The songs on the album are thematically focused on sex, love and Spears\' relationship–struggle with the media.\n\nBlackout debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming her first and so far only studio album not to debut at number one due to a last-minute rules change by the Billboard music association. According to the IFPI, the album was 32nd in terms of units shipped by the end of 2007.\n\nThe album\'s first single, ""Gimme More"", peaked at number one in the Canadian Hot 100 and became a top five hit in twelve countries. The second single, ""Piece of Me"", reached number one in Ireland. The final single, ""Break the Ice"", reached number one in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, making all the singles of the album go to the top position of at least a chart. All three songs frequently appeared on the lists that included the best records of the year. Even though initial critical response was mixed to positive, the album later won high critical acclaim and appeared on many lists that included the decade\'s best albums. The album was named the 5th ""Best Pop Album of the Decade"" by The Times, the 7th-best album of the decade on the Rolling Stones ""The Decade-End Readers’ Poll"", and the 3rd Best Album of the decade on the Billboard ""Readers Poll"", and won ""Album of the Year"" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. To date, the album has sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Blackout"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Here the centerpiece is the song ""Close to the Edge"". Later Yes albums that follow a similar pattern are Relayer (1974) (which features ""The Gates of Delirium"") and Going for the One (1977) (which features ""Awaken"").\n\nThe spiritual influences introduced by Jon Anderson, which later formed the basis of Tales from Topographic Oceans, are already evident in the music and lyrics of all three tracks on Close to the Edge. Renewal and repetition are other main themes; the title track starts and finishes with the same sound effects of running water and birds, and in ""Siberian Khatru"" there is the repetition of two-syllable words and phrases.\n\nAccording to the group\'s fans, the title track is inspired by Hermann Hesse\'s book Siddhartha. This interpretation, which can cast the cryptic and mysterious lyrics in a new light, reads the song as tracking the awakening of Hesse\'s character ""close to the edge"" of a river (and, symbolically, of the serial lifetimes of his soul), where he experiences a spiritual awakening.\n\nIn June 1972, just as recording ended, drummer Bill Bruford suddenly left the line-up to play with King Crimson, forcing Yes to find a replacement drummer (ex-Plastic Ono Band member Alan White) before starting a new U.S. tour.\n\n \nInside of the Close to the Edge LP cover.The cover art was by Roger Dean. Some of the photography for the album sleeve was by bass player Chris Squire\'s former bandmate in the Selfs and The Syn, Martyn Adelman.\n\nThe album is listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nProgarchives.com voted it the greatest progressive album of all time in 2006. Guitar World ranked it #67 in their (Reader\'s Choice) list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time.\n\nRhino Records issued a remastered and expanded version of Close to the Edge on August 26, 2003. It added four bonus tracks: single versions of ""America"" and ""Total Mass Retain"" and early versions of ""And You and I"" and ""Siberian Khatru"" (as ""Siberia"").\n\nClose to the Edge (Atlantic K 50012) was released on Atlantic Records in September 1972. It reached #4 in the UK, and it reached #3 in the U.S. during a chart stay of 32 weeks. In the Netherlands it reached #1 on the Dutch album charts, and has been the only Yes album to do so.\n\n\nSide one\n""Close to the Edge"" (Jon Anderson, Steve Howe) – 18:43 \n""The Solid Time of Change"" \n""Total Mass Retain"" \n""I Get Up I Get Down"" \n""Seasons of Man""  (song sample - 176K) \n\nSide two\n""And You and I"" (Anderson; Themes by Bill Bruford, Howe, Chris Squire) – 10:08 \n""Cord of Life"" (Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Squire) \n""Eclipse"" (Anderson, Bruford, Howe) \n""The Preacher the Teacher"" (Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Squire) \n""Apocalypse"" (Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Squire) \n""Siberian Khatru"" (Anderson; Themes by Anderson, Howe, Rick Wakeman) – 8:55 \n\n Bonus tracks (2003 reissue)\n""America (Single version)"" (Paul Simon) – 4:12 \n""Total Mass Retain (Single version)"" – 3:21 \n""And You and I (Alternate version)"" – 10:17 \n""Siberia"" (Studio run-through of ""Siberian Khatru"") – 9:19 \n\nPersonnel\nJon Anderson – vocals \nChris Squire – bass, vocals \nSteve Howe – guitars, vocals \nRick Wakeman – keyboards \nBill Bruford – drums, percussion \n\n\n\nYear Chart Position \n1972 Billboard Pop Albums 3 \n\nSingles\n\nYear Single Chart Position \n1972 ""And You and I"" Billboard Pop Singles 42 \n\n\nCertifications\nOrganization Level Date \nRIAA – U.S. Gold October 30, 1972 \nCRIA – Canada Gold December 1, 1976 \nCRIA – Canada Platinum December 1, 1977 \nBPI – UK Gold December 5, 1984 \nBPI – UK Platinum December 5, 1984 \n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yes/Close+to+the+Edge"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The record garnered much critical acclaim upon its release, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2004.\n\nElephant""  is a strong, deep album showcasing Jack White at the top of his game. He rocks every guitar style that he tries including blues and slide guitar and even does a great job on a Burt Bacharach cover. It\'s just one more  example of Detroit\'s enduring musical legacy. \n\nElephant was recorded in two weeks during 2002 in London\'s Toe Rag Studios. Jack White produced the album with antiquated equipment, including an eight-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear.\n\nThe album has been released with at least six different versions of the front cover—different covers for the CD and LP editions in the US, the UK and elsewhere. To give an example, on the US CD edition Meg White is sitting on the left of a circus travel trunk and Jack is sitting on the right holding a cricket bat over the ground, while on the UK CD edition the cricket bat touches the ground and the image is mirrored so that their positions on the amplifier are reversed. The cryptic symbolism of the album art includes a skull sitting on the floor in the background, as well as peanuts and peanut shells in the foreground, and on the circus travel trunk appears the mark ""III,"" Jack White\'s signature. Jack White is also displaying a mano cornuta, while Meg White appears to be barefoot and crying, with a rope tied around her ankle and leading out of frame. Both have small white ribbons tied to their fingers.\n\nIn an interview with Q Magazine in 2007, Jack White said, ""If you study the picture carefully, Meg and I are elephant ears in a head-on elephant. But it\'s a side view of an elephant, too, with the tusks leading off either side."" He went on to say, ""I wanted people to be staring at this album cover and then maybe two years later, having stared at it for the 500th time, to say, \'Hey, it\'s an elephant!\'""\n\nThe White Stripes were gaining momentum with their previous three albums and were generally lauded in critical circles. Upon its release, critical response to this album was overwhelmingly positive, and many critics hailed it as the one of the defining events of the 2000s garage rock revival. Uncut magazine remarked that ""Elephant is where the tabloid phenomenon of summer 2001 prove they are no flash in the pan by making a truly phenomenal record."" David Fricke (with Rolling Stone) called it ""a work of pulverizing perfection,"" adding, ""It will be one of the best things you hear all year."" and Allmusic said the album ""overflows with quality"". Critics also commented on the development of the band. NME noted that ""The eloquence, barbarism, tenderness and sweat-drenched vitality of Elephant make it the most fully-realised White Stripes album yet."" PopMatters said the album cemented ""their evolution from Blind Willie McTell cover band with a pop sensibility to full-fledged, honest-to-goodness rock \'n\' roll gods."" The album enjoys a metacritic rating of 92. Negative critique, though rare, was centered around the ""gimmicks"" that surround the music, most notably, the White Stripes\' insistence on being called siblings. ""So maybe it\'s time to drop the enigmatic charade,"" Lorraine Ali (with Newsweek) pleaded, although she concluded, ""Elephant still sounds great.""\n\nThe album debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and reached number six on the Billboard 200 in the US. The album won Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song (""Seven Nation Army""). In 2003, the album was ranked number 390 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was also placed thirty-ninth in Channel 4\'s list of the 100 Greatest Albums of all time. In December 2003, NME made it their Album of the Year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/Elephant"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Indeed, the album often sounded more like vocal jazz or folk than soul, beginning with the credits: a core quartet of Flack on piano, John Pizzarelli on guitar, Ron Carter on bass, and Ray Lucas on drums, as fine a lineup as any pop singer could hope to recruit. With only one exception -- the bluesy, grooving opener ""Compared to What,"" during which Flack proves her chops as a soul belter -- she concentrates on readings of soft, meditative material. A pair of folk covers, ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" and ""Hey, That\'s No Way to Say Goodbye,"" are heart-wrenching standouts; the first even became a surprise hit two years later, when its appearance in the Clint Eastwood film Play Misty for Me pushed it to the top of the pop charts and earned Flack her first Grammy award for Record of the Year. Her arrangement of the traditional ""I Told Jesus"" has a simmering power, while ""Ballad of the Sad Young Men"" summons a stately sense of melancholy. Flack also included two songs from her college friend and future duet partner, Donny Hathaway, including a tender examination of the classic May-December romance titled ""Our Ages or Our Hearts."" The string arrangements of William Fischer wisely keep to the background, lending an added emotional weight to all of Flack\'s pronouncements. No soul artist had ever recorded an album like this, making First Take one of the most fascinating soul debuts of the era. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Roberta+Flack/First+Take"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rykodisc re-released the album around the world in 2005. Pretty Hate Machine is compiled of tracks from the Purest Feeling demo, as well as tracks recorded after the Purest Feeling recording. The album spawned three singles, the most successful being ""Head Like a Hole"", which has become a staple in Nine Inch Nails\' live performances. A remastered version was issued on November 22, 2010.\n \nHistory\nWorking nights at Right Track Studio as a handyman and janitor, Reznor used studio ""down-time"" to record and develop his own music. Playing most of the keyboards, drum machines, guitars, and samplers himself, he recorded a demo. The sequencing was done on a Macintosh Plus.\n\nTeaming up with manager John Malm, Jr., they sent the demo to various record labels. Reznor received serious offers from many of them, but eventually signed a deal with TVT Records who, until then, were known mainly for releasing novelty and television jingle records. Pretty Hate Machine was recorded in various studios around the world with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Trent Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording Pretty Hate Machine mostly by himself.\n\nReleased on October 20, 1989, the album was a critical and commercial success, receiving radio airplay for the singles ""Down in It"", ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Sin"". The songs ""Terrible Lie"" and ""Something I Can Never Have"" also received moderate airplay along with the three lead singles. Pretty Hate Machine also gained popularity through word-of-mouth and developed an underground following. Reznor quickly hired a band for touring with The Jesus and Mary Chain, including guitarist and future Filter frontman Richard Patrick. Nine Inch Nails\' live set during the time was known for louder, more aggressive versions of the studio songs, and also for destroying their instruments at the end, (Reznor preferred using the heel of his boots to strip the keys from expensive keyboards, most notably the Yamaha DX7).\n\nSince the album was released, a recording known as Purest Feeling surfaced. This bootleg album contains the original demo recordings of most of the tracks found on Pretty Hate Machine, as well as a couple that were not used (""Purest Feeling"", ""Maybe Just Once"" and an instrumental intro to ""Sanctified"" called ""Slate"").\n\nPretty Hate Machine went out of print through TVT Records, but was reissued by Rykodisc on November 22, 2005 with slight changes in the packaging. Reznor had expressed an interest in creating a ""deluxe edition"" with surround sound remastering and new/rare remixes, similar to the re-release of The Downward Spiral. Rykodisc liked the idea, but wanted Reznor to pay them to handle the process of remastering, repackaging, and re-releasing the album.\n\nOn March 29th, 2010, the master recording rights of Pretty Hate Machine were acquired by The Bicycle Music Company, and on October 22nd, 2010, Trent Reznor announced on nin.com that on November 22nd, 2010, a remastered issue of the album would be released by UMe and The Bicycle Music Company. The re-release includes slightly different cover art by Rob Sheridan and the bonus track ""Get Down, Make Love"", a Queen cover originally found on the ""Sin"" single.\n\nLeading up to the re-release of the album, a website was put up for fans at http://phm.nin.com/, featuring content from videos and tours for Pretty Hate Machine. The videos for ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Down in It"" featured newly remastered sound, the uncut video for ""Sin"" (a remix for the video was used, so it was not remastered) and two early live video segments; one with interviews.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by Trent Reznor. \n\n1.

The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists. There have been attempts by several artists to play cover versions of songs from Ege Bamyası. Remix versions of several tracks by various artists are included on the album Sacrilege. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Can/Ege+Bamyasi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by David Cobb, the album was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\nInitially set to be produced by Isbell\'s friend and touring companion Ryan Adams, the album was recorded following a stint in rehab, with Isbell noting, ""This time I want to remember it all.""\n\nBackground and recording\n\nThe album was recorded without the full participation of Jason Isbell\'s regular backing band The 400 Unit, with Isbell noting: ""It really came to the nature of the songs more than anything else. It’s a very personal record for me. And I had gone into the studio with the intention of making more of a solo, acoustic album. But Dave , the producer, and I both sort of got bored with that idea and we decided to bring a band in for some things."" The 400 Unit band members Chad Gamble and Derry deBorja appear on drums and keyboards, respectively.\n\nProducer Dave Cobb encouraged Isbell to record his vocals in one take: ""I think the big difference is that during the process we kept a lot of live vocal takes and I’ve not done that in the past. I was sort of terrified, really. Before, we’d spend a couple days at the end of the sessions tuning everything. Dave Cobb really encouraged me to sing with the live tracks while we were recording it.""\n\nIsbell finished recording Southeastern one or two days before his wedding to musician Amanda Shires, saying he ""even went back and did some final touches on Sunday after the wedding before we went on our honeymoon.\n\nOn the title, Isbell said that geography ""wasn\'t actually the reason I named the album that. That came from a tool and die shop in Alabama that my dad worked at when I was very young. He came home with terrible stories; I thought of the place as a dungeon. So I wanted to reclaim that for my own purposes.""\n\nWriting and composition\n\nThe album\'s title stems from Isbell\'s childhood, with Isbell stating, ""My dad used to work for a tool-and-die shop when I was a kid that was called Southeastern and that’s how it originally occurred to me. I had moved from Muscle Shoals to Nashville - almost a year ago now — and it struck me that, at this point in my life, I don’t have any interest in living in any other part of the country or the world, really.""\n\nThe album\'s fourth track, ""Elephant"", focuses upon cancer, with Isbell stating: ""It\'s something that everyone has had an experience with, or they will have. It can be difficult, but it\'s supposed to be. You\'re supposed to give enough of a damn about the songs you\'re singing that you might get a little choked up a little during one of \'em.""\n\nThe track, ""Yvette"", which deals with sexual abuse, is a companion piece to the track, ""Daisy Mae"", on Isbell\'s previous studio album, Here We Rest (2011). He notes, ""I got to a point, I guess when I was probably thirty, or thirty-one years old, where it occurred to me almost everyone you meet was sexually abused as a kid, almost everybody, by someone. That never happened to me, believe it or not, but the percentages are just staggering, and writing a song about something that’s that depressing I think it’s good to discuss it. Some people like to discuss those things, maybe they don’t want to start the conversation themselves, but sometimes those things help folks to relate and get those things out of their system a little bit.""\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe album debuted at No. 23 on Billboard 200, and No. 7 on Top Rock Albums, selling 18,000 copies in its first week. It has sold 148,000 copies in the United States as of June 2015. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Isbell/Southeastern"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is noted for its sophisticated, orchestral production methods and complex arrangements. The tracks on the first half of Today! feature an electric guitar-rock oriented sound that contrasts the second half consisting of ballads, showing an increased mature lyrical depth that would foreshadow future efforts like Pet Sounds.\nDespite the album\'s being a noted departure from the Beach Boys sound that largely pervaded prior efforts, the album was a commercial success; Today! climbed to number four in the US chart during a chart stay of 50 weeks and also reached number six in the British chart during the summer of 1966. The album was placed at number 271 in the Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/The+Beach+Boys+Today!"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

BLACKsummers\'night is Maxwell\'s first album since his hiatus after his third album, Now (2001), and serves as the first part of his scheduled trilogy of albums. The music of BLACKsummers\'night is rooted in general soul music, and is more straightforward than previous albums such as Embrya (1998). Maxwell\'s lyrics concern his falling in and out of love during his sabbatical period prior to the album\'s release.\nThe album debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 316,000 copies, and it also peaked at number 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Internet Albums charts. Its first single, ""Pretty Wings"", peaked at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Upon release, the album received universal acclaim from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 85/100 from Metacritic. BLACKsummers\'night earned praise for its production and was viewed as an improvement over Maxwell\'s previous work, in terms of lyrics and instrumentation.. As Of 2nd December 2009, The Album has been nominated for 6 Grammy awards. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Maxwell/BLACKsummers%27night"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It also became the band\'s biggest-selling album in the United States, with more than six million copies to date.\nWith the advent of punk rock, The Rolling Stones, among many of their musical contemporaries, were being targeted by some in the movement as cultural dinosaurs, compromising their standing. Mick Jagger felt invigorated by the provocations and was determined to answer them lyrically. It helped, however, that almost all the punks had, openly or not, idolized the Stones in the 1960s and were heavily influenced by the band\'s rebellious records from that era.\n\nAt least as important for the band\'s reinvigoration was the addition of Ronnie Wood to the lineup, as Some Girls was the first album recorded with him as a full member. His guitar playing style meshed with that of Keith Richards. Wood\'s pedal steel playing would become one of the band\'s hallmarks, and his unconventional uses of the instrument are prominent on Some Girls. In addition, Jagger, who had learned to play guitar over the previous decade, contributed a third guitar part to many songs. This gave songs like ""Respectable"" a three-guitar lineup. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Some+Girls"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the United States that single, along with ""A Change (Would Do You Good),"" had received tremendous cross-genre airplay in several radio formats, illustrating the comparative eclecticism that the album introduced without denting its artist\'s mainstream appeal.\n\nThe thematic and stylistic differences between this release and Crow\'s 1993 debut, Tuesday Night Music Club, were and are quite noteworthy to the listener and the commercial music world.  It has a wider range of instrumentation and soundscape, such as the use of percussion loops, banjo and steel guitar (among other, less common instruments), and sometimes slower and more complex rhythms. The lyrics display a much broader variety of emotion and subject matter than Crow had shown previously.  For example, the song ""Love Is a Good Thing"" contains the lyrics ""Watch out sister, watch out brother/watch our children while they kill each other/with a gun they bought at a Wal-Mart discount store"" (in criticism of Wal-Mart\'s gun sales policy).  Wal-Mart banned the album at its stores, which would have been unthinkable for Music Club, or for that matter any of Crow\'s ensuing albums.  Much of ""Sheryl Crow\'s"" content stands out as a distinct departure from Crow\'s overall style of extremely pop-friendly, accessible and upbeat mainstream rock.\n\nTwo of this album\'s songs, ""Redemption Day"" and the single ""Every Day is a Winding Road,"" were prominently featured in the very successful 2000 U. S. film Erin Brokovich and are on its soundtrack.\n <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sheryl+Crow/Sheryl+Crow"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They are also noted for Russell Mael\'s distinctive falsetto voice and Ron Mael\'s intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style.\n\nWhile achieving chart success in various countries around the world including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and the United States, they have enjoyed a cult following since their first releases. During the late 1970s, when in collaboration with Giorgio Moroder (and Telex subsequently), Sparks reinvented themselves as a new wave/synth-pop band, and abandoned the traditional rock band line-up. Their frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music.\n\nThe 2002 release of Lil\' Beethoven, their ""genre-defying opus"", as well as the more recent albums Hello Young Lovers (2006, their 20th studio album), Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), and their latest fantasy musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009–2010) have brought Sparks renewed critical and commercial success, and seen them continue to ""steer clear of pop conventions."" The band also released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS, released in 2015.\n\nSparks are best known for the songs ""This Town Ain\'t Big Enough for Both of Us"", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit ""The Number One Song in Heaven"" in 1979; ""When I\'m With You"" which topped the French Singles Chart in 1980; the single ""I Predict"", which provided Sparks\' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single ""Cool Places"" with the Go-Go\'s rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and ""When Do I Get to Sing \'My Way\'"" which topped the German and European charts in 1994/95 and was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sparks/Kimono+My+House"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album produced four number-one singles (one posthumous) on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart, the only Spanish album by a female to achieve this feat.\n\nAlbum history\nContinuing the formula of previous albums, A.B. Quintanilla III teamed up with Pete Astudillo and Ricky Vela to come up with what they hoped would be a successful Selena album. Its singles (""Amor Prohibido"", ""No Me Queda Más"", ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"", and ""Fotos Y Recuerdos"") became hits at radio stations in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nOriginal pressings of this album, included a mariachi like version, of the song ""No Me Queda Más"". Selena would later re-record a more contemporary version, to help attract a wider audience. Pressings of the album with the re-recorded version, have a decorative red stamp in the top right corner, indicating the change.\n\nSelena recorded a song with Latin pop group Barrio Boyzz, titled ""Donde Quiera Que Estés"", prior to recording Amor Prohibido. The duet was another number one hit for Selena. This track originally appeared on the Barrio Boyzz album of the same title and is included on the 2002 reissued version of this album as a bonus track.\n\nThe album made the Billboard 200 pop albums chart and replaced Gloria Estefan\'s Mi Tierra at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. It spent twenty non-consecutive weeks at number one on the chart over the next year, the final 16 weeks being propelled by Selena\'s death in March 1995. It also led to six awards at the Tejano Music Awards, another Grammy nomination in 1995 for Best Mexican/Mexican-American album, and Lo Nuestro award for ""Regional Mexican Album of the Year"". The unexpected success of this album led to extensive touring and promotion that is much to blame for the stalled efforts of recording Selena\'s English-language album, Dreaming of You, which was incomplete and posthumously released in 1995.\n\nThe album was certified Platinum (Latin type) shortly after its March 1994 release for selling over 200,000 units.  To capitalize on the success Capitol/EMI-Latin records re-released the album with a red label on the front cover indicating that album included a new version of ""No Me Queda Más"".\n\nCharts\nAlbum\n\nYear                   Chart                                                     Position  Weeks \nMay 6, 1995      Billboard 200                                      29             23 weeks \nJune 11, 1994 Billboard Latin Albums                       1              147 weeks \nApril 9, 1994    Billboard Mexican Regional albums 1             144 weeks \n\nSingles released\n1.""Amor Prohibido"" #1 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n2.""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"" #1 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n3.""No Me Queda Más"" #1 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n4.""Fotos Y Recuerdos"" # 1 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n5.""Si Una Vez"" #4 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n6.""El Chico Del Apartamento 512"" #6 Billboard Hot Latin Tracks\n\nCertifications\n\n Note that RIAA has launched its Oro y De Platino certification scheme for those albums the 50% of the content of which are in Spanish, initially, the award-levels for Oro y De Platino were: Gold=100,000 and Platinum=200,000.

Along with albums like To Whom it May Concern… by Freestyle Fellowship, and I Wish My Brother George Was Here by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Bizarre Ride helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, The Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite the wide acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at #75 on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1993. However, on the strength of the second single, ""Passing Me By,"" the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America on March 28, 1996. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pharcyde/Bizarre+Ride+II+The+Pharcyde"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Production was handled primarily by Mayer and Steve Jordan. It marked a change in Mayer\'s musical style, and incorporated musical elements of blues and soul more heavily than in his previous work with pop-rock.\n\nThe album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 300,186 copies in its first week. It also reached the top-ten in several other countries and sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Upon its release, Continuum received generally positive reviews from most music critics and earned Mayer several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 49th Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone magazine named it the eleventh best album of 2006.\n\nBackground\n\nMayer made the decision to name his third album Continuum at least a year before the album was released. In his column in the April 2005 issue of Esquire, Mayer wrote, ""I\'m obsessed with time lately, constantly crunching the numbers to get some sense of where I stand in the continuum."" In his column in the September 2005 issue of Esquire he confirmed the title, writing, ""I\'ve never experienced anything like the recording process involved in making Continuum, my third-album-to-be.\n\nThe album features mainly new songs, though ""Gravity"" and ""Vultures"" are available in live versions from John Mayer Trio\'s Try!, and ""Bold as Love"", which is a Jimi Hendrix cover: the first Hendrix cover that Mayer has ever recorded as a studio release (although Mayer has recorded other Hendrix songs over time in live settings such as ""The Wind Cries Mary"" and ""Wait Until Tomorrow""). (Mayer had played ""Bold as Love"" live many times prior to the release of Continuum such as on the televised Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope which aired on January 15, 2005.) The album contains a collaboration between Mayer and 8-string guitarist Charlie Hunter on the tune ""In Repair"". The song ""Stop this Train"" was written during a time of, what Mayer calls, ""solitary refinement;"" He was in bed suffering from double kidney stones, and living in a hotel while finding a new residence.\n\nCover art\n\nThe word ""Continuum"" is showcased across the center. The typography for the title was customized to give the letters ""C"" and ""o"" the appearance of an infinity symbol: ∞. Many of the following letters touch in some way; the right vertical line of the second ""u"" is the left vertical line of the ""m"" in the title.\n\nThe album has been released several times with slight differences in the artwork. The three major releases feature, respectively: A photo of Mayer; a silver cover with a white title; and a Local 83-only version (including a silver bag). The first features a dark gray-scale photograph of Mayer with the title near the top; another is identical except for ""featured"" centered across the top. Some versions feature only a CD. In these cases, the album features Mayer on the cover. When the album is packaged with a jewel casing, the inside cover is all white with the ""Continuum"" logo printed very faintly on it. The basic CD is white with off-white letters that slides into a slipcase of deep gray with lettering in light gray and blue/green. During the pre-order, it appeared as though there would be a variation of said artwork on a special edition version, and it turned out that the ""special packaging"" was a shiny silver bag which held the CD and the pre-order bonuses. All artwork was designed by Mayer along with Smog Design, Inc. The inside of the CD sleeve includes photographs, some taken by Mayer, such as of the studio (where Mayer\'s handwriting describes, ""*this is what my heart looks like*"") and a Ferris wheel where Mayer\'s handwriting is imposed over the top of the photograph, featuring the lyrics to his songs. There is also a photograph of Mayer with Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan (the three who comprise the John Mayer Trio) on a beach. The CD sleeve features the lyrics to all of Continuum\'s songs. With both Heavier Things and Room for Squares, there were incongruities with the lyrics in the sleeves when compared with the albums; however, the Continuum lyrics are all printed exactly as recorded on the album.\n\nThe UK version of Continuum features a photograph of Mayer on the cover. This cover was used for promotional releases, such as when Mayer performed live on the Australian television program Rove Live. The alternative cover was presented for television by the show\'s host Rove McManus.\n\nIn November 2007, a special edition of Continuum was released. The cover for the special edition features a grey background and silver text for the title, with the Columbia Records logo in black instead of white. However, the line ""Music by John Mayer"" remains the same teal color as on the regular release. The cover layout is the same.\n\nRelease and Promotion\n\nBy the time of release, Mayer had performed almost all of the songs live at least once, either with a full band or alone in an acoustic set during the Hotel Cafe shows from the previous winter. On August 23, 2006, the entire Continuum album was played on Los Angeles radio station STAR 98.7, with the segment hosted by Mayer himself. He repeated the event for different media outlets several more times before the album\'s September release, such as ""Sneak Peek"" through Clear Channel Music; he also performed three songs live for Sessions@AOL. Subsequently, the album was made available for streaming on Clear Channel Music website and for pre-purchase on iTunes, all prior to the album\'s official release. The iTunes pre-release included the exclusive bonus track, ""Can\'t Take That Plane"".\n\nA limited edition EP of ""Waiting on the World to Change"" was released featuring the album version of the song. The EP includes a bonus acoustic version which features Ben Harper, as well as a studio recording of ""Good Love is on the Way"", a live version of which was released on the John Mayer Trio\'s Try!. The Ben Harper version of ""Waiting on the World to Change"" and an alternative acoustic-only version of ""Good Love is on the Way"" are also available on Mayer\'s subsequent release, the EP The Village Sessions.\n\nThe first single, ""Waiting on the World to Change,"" was released on July 11, 2006. The music video for the song was directed by Philip Andelman and features Mayer walking along the East River while graffiti artists Futura, Tats Cru, and Daze graffiti messages on New York City billboards displaying messages relating to the song\'s content. On February 22, 2007, Continuum\'s second single, ""Gravity"", entered the Billboard Hot 100 at #71, joining the already charting ""Waiting on the World to Change"", making for two Continuum singles on the Hot 100 at the same time. It was featured in the soundtrack for the television series House in 2008. ""Waiting"" entered the Billboard\'s Hot 100 Digital Songs Chart at #63. It has sold 68,115 in digital downloads since its release. Mayer performed the single ""Gravity"" at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards with fellow musicians Corinne Bailey Rae and John Legend. ""Dreaming with a Broken Heart"" is the third official single release from Continuum, and was released for ads at Hot AC and Triple A radio on July 9, 2007.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, a special edition of Continuum was released that included a bonus disc of six live tracks and a 20-page booklet containing photos from the tour. Five of the songs are live versions of tracks from Continuum, including all of its singles. A sixth song, ""I Don\'t Need No Doctor"", was originally performed by Ray Charles; Mayer previously performed the song as part of his set with the John Mayer Trio. The single ""Say"" (from The Bucket List soundtrack) was also made available on the CD through an online download unlock function. The tracks were produced by Mayer\'s engineer Chad Franscoviak.\n\nThe album was reissued on Columbia Records on April 8, 2008, with the single ""Say"" being added directly on the disc. A vinyl lp version of this reissue was also released, on two 180-gram discs.\n\nCommercial Performance\n\nContinuum debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at #2 with 300,186 copies sold. It never reached #1, impeded by the Justin Timberlake album FutureSex/LoveSounds, which was released at the same time. As on November 2009, Continuum has sold 2,800,000 copiesin the U.S. and is Mayer\'s third consecutive multi-platinum selling studio album. It stayed in the top 100 of Billboard\'s Hot 100 chart for 50 weeks (37 of those weeks were in the top 50).\n\nWorldwide, it has moved more than 3 million copies. In Canada, the album debuted at #2 on the official Albums Chart and is certified platinum for sales of 100,000 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Continuum was the fourth best selling digital album for 2006 in Canada. With no lead single in Australia, Continuum debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at #12, his lowest debut in Australia to date (Room for Squares debuted at #5 and Heavier Things at #4). Continuum was the ninety-eighth best selling album for 2006 on the ARIA (ARIA) Albums Chart. It has been certified gold by ARIA for sales of 35,000 copies and had stayed on ARIA\'s Top 100 Albums chart for 34 weeks before exiting the chart. Continuum held the record for the most album downloads in history with over 326,000 copies downloaded until June 29, 2008, when it was surpassed by the Coldplay album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.\n\nOn February 22, 2007, the lead single, ""Waiting on the World to Change"", peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, where it stayed for forty-one weeks. To date in the U.S., the single has sold 1,632,137 in digital downloads, and was certified platinum by the RIAA when it crossed the one-million mark in sales. After a month of release, the single peaked at #17 on the Australian ARIA Top 40 Digital Track Chart on November 19, 2006.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nContinuum received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 18 reviews. Matt Collar of Allmusic called it ""a gorgeously produced, brilliantly stripped-to-basics album that incorporates blues, soft-funk, R&B, folk and pop in a sound that is totally owned by Mayer."" Mojo called it a ""great blue-eyed soul record."" Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that Mayer is ""best when treading softly, finding the fluid heart of blue-eyed soul"", rather than on more ""angst""-filled songs. Bryan Borzykowski of Now felt that "" melodic voice, warm production, complex riffs and thoughtful lyrics should cure the violent reactions Mayer\'s name used to evoke."" MSN Music\'s Robert Christgau gave Continuum a three-star honorable mention ((3-star Honorable Mention)), indicating ""an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure"". He cited ""Waiting on the World to Change"" and ""The Heart of Life"" as highlights and quipped, ""Saying in so many words what his less-gifted, more-pretentious contemporaries think it\'s cool to camouflage"". Anthony DeCurtis, writing in Rolling Stone, called it ""a smart, breezy album that deftly fuses his love for old-school blues and R&B with his natural gift for sharp melodies and well-constructed songs."" The magazine later ranked it the eleventh best album of 2006.\n\nIn a mixed review, Slant Magazine\'s Jonathan Keefe wrote that, ""with no edge to the songwriting and with such spit-polished, tasteful production, Continuum just doesn\'t convince as a heady, soulful rock album or as Mayer\'s creative quantum leap forward"". Jody Rosen, writing for Entertainment Weekly, felt that Mayer is too ""classy"" and wrote that, although the songs are ""shapely"" and ""the musicianship is elegant and virtuosic"", the music\'s ""low-key loveliness dissipates into a sleep-inducing soft-rock haze."" Stylus Magazine stated that Mayer ""calmly circles the same career themes with the same warmed-over, palatable guitar weavings"". Q magazine called it ""dour stuff reminiscent of a yogic Sting.""\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n1. \t""Waiting on the World to Change""   \tJohn Mayer \t3:21\n2. \t""I Don\'t Trust Myself (With Loving You)""   \tMayer \t4:52\n3. \t""Belief""   \tMayer \t4:02\n4. \t""Gravity""   \tMayer \t4:05\n5. \t""The Heart of Life""   \tMayer \t3:19\n6. \t""Vultures""   \tMayer, Steve Jordan, Pino Palladino \t4:11\n7. \t""Stop This Train""   \tMayer \t4:45\n8. \t""Slow Dancing in a Burning Room""   \tMayer \t4:02\n9. \t""Bold as Love"" (The Jimi Hendrix Experience cover) \tJimi Hendrix \t4:18\n10. \t""Dreaming with a Broken Heart""   \tMayer \t4:07\n11. \t""In Repair""   \tMayer, Charlie Hunter \t6:09\n12. \t""I\'m Gonna Find Another You""   \tMayer \t2:43\nTotal length:\n\t49:54 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayer/Continuum"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The five songs were staples of—and essentially the basis of—The Stooges\' live set at the time. A typical Stooges song of the period would involve two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation. Presuming that the five songs as normally performed would cover requirements for the album, the Stooges were told by Elektra that they needed more material. According to Iggy Pop, ""We handed (the five-song version of the album) in and they refused it. They said, \'There aren\'t enough songs!\' So we lied and said, \'That\'s OK, we\'ve got lots more songs.\'"" (liner notes of 2005 reissue, p. 9)\n\nIn reality, the Stooges were about a day ahead of themselves when Iggy made that statement to Elektra; overnight, the group wrote three more songs, ""Real Cool Time"", ""Not Right"", and ""Little Doll"", and played them for the first time in the studio.\n\nAn initial mix by producer John Cale, apparently resembling ex-Velvet Underground bandmate Lou Reed\'s ""closet mix"" of that band\'s eponymous third album of the same year, was rejected by Elektra. The mix as heard on the final product was done by Iggy Pop and Elektra Records president Jac Holzman. Four of Cale\'s original mixes would later appear on the bonus disc of a 2005 re-issued version, with pitch correction applied to them. Five years later, all Cale mixes were released unaltered on the first disc of a 2010 collector\'s edition release of the album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges/The+Stooges"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although Raitt only wrote two original songs for the album, the nine cover songs she chose also covey the overarching themes of adulthood and wisdom.\n\nNick of Time topped the Billboard 200 chart and won three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, which was presented to Raitt and producer Don Was. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt/Nick+of+Time"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During the amazing success of I Want You and his stellar Live at the London Palladium album, Marvin Gaye was served with divorce papers from his then-wife Anna Gordy Gaye (sister of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy). One of the conditions of the settlement was that Gordy Gaye would receive an extensive percentage of royalties as well as a portion of the advance for his next album. Initially, Gaye was contemplating giving less than his best effort, as he wouldn\'t stand to receive any money, but then reconsidered at the last moment. The result is a two-disc-long confessional on the deterioration of their marriage; starting from the opening notes of the title track, Gaye viciously cuts with every lyric deeper into an explanation of why the relationship died the way it did. Gaye uses the album, right down to its packaging, to exorcise his personal demons with subtle visual digs and less-than-subtle lyrical attacks. The inner sleeve had a pseudo-board-game-like illustration entitled ""Judgment,"" in which a man\'s hand passes a record to a woman\'s. One side of the sleeve has Gaye\'s music and recording equipment, while the other side of the board included jewelry and other luxurious amenities. Musically the album retains the high standards Gaye set in the early \'70s, but you can hear the agonizing strain of recent events in his voice, to the point where even several vocal overdubs can\'t save his delivery. Stripped to its bare essence, Here, My Dear is no less than brilliantly unsettling and a perfect cauterization to a decade filled with personal turmoil.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye/Here,+My+Dear"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in 1977 on Red Star Records and produced by Craig Leon and Marty Thau. The album was recorded in four days at Ultima Sound Studios in New York as the group already had practiced and created songs from their previous five years of music gigs. The album featured songs about urban life and people who vocalist Alan Vega knew in New York. Vega\'s vocals on the album were influenced by 1950s rock musicians such as Elvis Presley while the backing music was provided by Martin Rev who provided a ""dense unnerving electronics"" sound.\n\nIt is often cited as one of the first synth pop albums, although it has a harsher, more industrial leaning than many well-known albums of the genre. In 2003, the album was ranked number 446 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n“Frankie Teardrop” is one of the songs featured in Nick Hornby’s 2002 book 31 Songs, and appears in Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1978 film In a Year of 13 Moons. “Cheree” is featured in the closing scene of Downtown 81 with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. “Girl” briefly appears in Nick Zedd’s 1979 film They Eat Scum. “Ghost Rider” was featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 video game Driver: Parallel Lines and also appears on True Crime: New York City. “Ghost Rider” has been covered by R.E.M., The Horrors, The Gories, Rollins Band, The Sisters of Mercy, Merzbow and The Young Gods, and was featured in a Brazilian deodorant commercial in 2005.\n\nIn September 2009 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow’s Parties-curated Don’t Look Back series. It\'s been played again in London in May 2010 when the band supported The Stooges performances of Raw Power. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Suicide/Suicide"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The most successful, ""Rebellion (Lies)"", peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Alternative Music Album. It received wide critical acclaim and topped many year-end lists. It was ranked eighth in Bob Mersereau\'s 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums, and #2 on Pitchfork\'s 200 Top Albums of the 2000s\n\nInitial critical response to Funeral was very positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 90, based on 30 reviews. Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five. He described it as ""brave, empowering, and dusted with something that many of the indie-rock genre\'s more contrived acts desperately lack: an element of real danger."" Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, saying that Funeral was ""...too fond of drama, but aware of its small place in the big world, and usually beautiful."" Pitchfork Media ranked the album #2 on their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list, after Radiohead\'s Kid A.\n\nDrowned in Sound also highly praised Funeral. Reviewer Jesus Chigley called the album ""...empowering and hopeful and euphoric all at once"", saying that ""it says everything there is to say about mortality and it does it in 10 tracks."" Stylus\'s Josh Drimmer gave Funeral an A, calling it ""celebratory, emotionally rich and life-affirming"" Dave Simpson of The Guardian called it ""one of the year\'s best already, by a mile."" Zeth Lundy of PopMatters complimented Funeral on its eccentricity, calling it ""bizarre at turns and recognizable elsewhere, equally beautiful and harrowing, theatrical and sincere, defying categorization while attempting to create new genres.\n\nTracklist\n01 Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) 4:48\n02 Neighborhood #2 (Laïka) 3:32\n03 Une Année Sans Lumière 3:41\n04 Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) 5:12\n05 Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) 4:49\n06 Crown Of Love 4:42\n07 Wake Up 5:35\n08 Haïti 4:07\n09 Rebellion (Lies) 5:12\n10 In The Backseat 6:20 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/Funeral"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
